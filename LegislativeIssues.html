    <h3>AHEM’s position on federal homeschooling legislation <span class="TableFont">AHEM’s philosophy is to strengthen the grassroots presence of homeschoolers, as our voices are strongest at the local and state level. It follows that it is wise to keep home-schooling out of federal law as much as possible to avoid further regulation and to keep the local, grassroots strength of homeschooling alive. </span></h3>

        <em>AHEM position: Opposed.

AHEM is also concerned that raising the  age to 18 could potentially remove alternatives, such as early graduation, from  motivated students for whom traditional public school is not working.</em><br />

        </strong>AN ACT RELATIVE TO MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND HOME EDUCATED  CHILDREN <br />
        Kevin J. Kuros<br />
        Sept. 9, 2015 — Hearing<br />
        Mar 10, 2015 — Referred to the committee on Education<br />
        See the full text of  H427 here : https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H427<strong></strong><br />
        <em>Summary: This bill was  filed so that home educated students who live in towns in MA whose libraries  have been decertified by the state due to not meeting the minimum requirements  for funding, staffing and hours will have the ability to borrow books from other  towns’ libraries. <br />
        <br />
        Background: When a library is decertified, it loses its right to cooperative  borrowing privileges with other libraries. While local libraries are free to  make their own policies regarding whether or not to allow residents of a decertified  town to have borrowing privileges, the recommendation from the Massachusetts  Board of Library Commissioners is to </em>not<em> extend borrowing privileges to decertified town residents in order to impress  on decertified towns the importance of supporting their local library, and to give  those in town a good argument in fighting for funding for the library. Due to  this policy, the number of decertified libraries in MA is extremely small. </em><br />
      <em>AHEM’s position:  Opposed. We do not think homeschooled students should be singled out for  special privileges over anyone else in the state; we do not think the state  should legislate what is now a municipal funding and policy decision; and we  stand strong with libraries in supporting their policy which has been  successful in maintaining a strong library system across the state. Ultimately  we feel that there most likely exists a more effective way to get books into  the hands of homeschooled students in decertified towns that would not impact  all homeschoolers and libraries across the state.</em>      </p>

        Kevin J. Kuros<br />
        Sept. 9, 2015 — Hearing Mar 10, 2015 — Referred to the committee  on Education SECTION 1. Section 8 of Chapter 78 of the General Laws, as  appearing in the 2012 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after  the first paragraph, the following sentence:<br />
        No free town public library shall refuse to loan its  books or other library material to any home educated child residing in the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts, provided that proof of home education is  presented upon the loan request.</p>

            AN ACT RELATIVE TO MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND HOME EDUCATED CHILDREN <br />
            Kevin J. Kuros<br />
          </p>
          <p>Sept. 9, 2015 — Hearing scheduled  from 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM in A-2<br />
            Jan 20, 2015 — Referred to the committee on Education<br />
          SECTION 1. Section 8 of Chapter 78 of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2012 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the first paragraph, the following sentence:</p>
<p>No free town public library shall refuse to loan its books or other library material to any home educated child residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, provided that proof of home education is presented upon the loan request.</p>
          <p><em>Summary: This bill was filed so that home educated students who live in towns in MA whose libraries have been decertified by the state due to not meeting the minimum requirements for funding, staffing, and hours will have the ability to borrow books from other towns’ libraries.</em></p>
          <p><em>Background: When a library is decertified, it loses its right to cooperative borrowing privileges with other libraries. While local libraries are free to make their own policies regarding whether or not to allow residents of a decertified town to have borrowing privileges, the recommendation from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners is to not extend borrowing privileges to decertified town residents in order to impress on decertified towns the importance of supporting their local library, and to give those in town a good argument in fighting for funding for the library. Due to this policy, the number of decertified libraries in MA is extremely small.</em></p>
          <p><em>AHEM’s position: Opposed. We do not think homeschooled students should be singled out for special privileges over anyone else in the state; we do not think the state should legislate what is now a municipal funding and policy decision; and we stand with libraries in supporting their policy which has been successful in maintaining a strong library system across the state. Ultimately we feel that there most likely exists a more effective way to get books into the hands of homeschooled students in decertified towns that would not impact all homeschoolers and libraries across the state.</em></p>
          <p><em>On top of all that, H 427 introduces the term “home educated” into statutory law, begging that it be defined, and possibly creating more problems for homeschoolers than it solves. We have discussed our concerns with Rep. Kuros. While Rep. Kuros still feels his bill is necessary, he has agreed to adopt an amendment to his bill to use “otherwise instructed” instead of “home educated” should the bill advance. </em></p>

<div></div>
      <div>
        <p>AHEM continues to monitor bills pending in the 189th legislative session for any action taken on education bills that may impact Massachusetts homeschoolers. The current session, which began in January 2015, runs for two years. Two bills (<a href="#s251">S 251</a> and <a href="#h411">H 411</a>) have been reported favorably out of the Education committee and have been sent to the Senate and House Ways and Means committees.</p>
        <p>Because the session is still in its early stages, we will not likely see further action taken on pending bills until late fall 2015 into spring 2016. Below is a summary of the current status of the education bills AHEM is tracking: </p>

<h2> April 2015   LEGISLATIVE UPDATE</h2>      
      <p>Our Massachusetts Legislature began its 189th session  on January 7, 2015. Several bills affecting school attendance age that died  during the188th session have been resurrected in a flurry of new  filings. Below is a summary of bills filed so far this session that could impact  Massachusetts homeschoolers. At this time no action needs to be taken on any of  these bills. AHEM will continue to monitor these and any additional education  bills that may be filed during the 189th Session.
      </p>
    <h6>Bill concerning  homeschoolers and public libraries</h6>        
        <p><strong>H 427<br />
        </strong>AN ACT RELATIVE TO MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND HOME EDUCATED  CHILDREN Kevin J. Kuros<br />
      Mar 10, 2015 — Referred to the committee on Education      </p>
      <p> SECTION 1. Section 8 of Chapter 78 of the General Laws, as appearing in the  2012 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the first  paragraph, the following sentence:</p>
      <p> No free town public library  shall refuse to loan its books or other library material to any home educated  child residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, provided that proof of  home education is presented upon the loan request.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><em>Summary: This bill was  filed so that home educated students who live in towns in MA whose libraries  have been decertified by the state due to not meeting the minimum requirements  for funding, staffing and hours will have the ability to borrow books from  other towns’ libraries.</em></p>
      <p><em>Background: When a library is decertified, it loses its right to cooperative  borrowing privileges with other libraries. While local libraries are free to  make their own policies regarding whether or not to allow residents of a  decertified town to have borrowing privileges, the recommendation from the  Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners is to </em>not<em> extend borrowing privileges to decertified town residents in order to  impress on decertified towns the importance of supporting their local library,  and to give those in town a good argument in fighting for funding for the  library. Due to this policy, the number of decertified libraries in MA is  extremely small.</em></p>
      <p><em>AHEM’s position: Opposed.  We do not think homeschooled students should be singled out for special  privileges over anyone else in the state; we do not think the state should  legislate what is now a municipal funding and policy decision; and we stand  strong with libraries in supporting their policy which has been successful in  maintaining a strong library system across the state. Ultimately we feel that  there most likely exists a more effective way to get books into the hands of  homeschooled students in decertified towns that would not impact all  homeschoolers and libraries across the state.</em></p>
      <p><em>On top of all that, H  427 introduces the term “home educated” into statutory law, begging that it be  defined, and possibly creating more problems for homeschoolers than it solves. We  have discussed our concerns with Rep. Kuros. While Rep. Kuros still feels his  bill is necessary, he has agreed to adopt an amendment to his bill to use  “otherwise instructed” instead of “home educated.”</em>      </p>
      <h6>Bill concerning MCAS</h6>
      <p><strong>H 411<br />
        </strong>AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO THE MCAS EXAM  Bradley H. Jones, Jr. + sponsors<strong><br />
        </strong>Mar 10, 2015 — Referred to the committee on Education
      </p>
      <p>
      SECTION 1. The department of elementary and secondary  education shall issue a report on the feasibility and costs associated with  non-public school students and home schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily  taking the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exam; provided that  said report shall be provided to the secretary of administration and finance,  the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, and the clerks of the  senate and house of representatives who shall forward the same to the chair of  the senate ways and means committee, the chair of the house ways and means  committee, and the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on education  within 6 months of the effective date of this act.</p>
      <p> <em>Summary: Would issue a report on allowing  private and homeschooled students to take the MCAS. AHEM contacted Rep. Jones  and asked that “and home schooled students” be removed from the language of the  bill, as homeschoolers are included in the category “non-public school  students” and introducing the term “home schooled” into statutory language begs  for it to be defined. Rep. Jones’s aide assured us that they would recommend  amending the language to avoid redundancy.</em></p>
      <p><em>AHEM’s position: If  language is amended, neutral.</em>      </p>

      <p><em>AHEM position: Neutral.</em></p>
