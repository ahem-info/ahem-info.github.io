    <h5>AHEM’s position on federal homeschooling legislation <span class="TableFont">AHEM’s philosophy is to strengthen the grassroots presence of homeschoolers, as our voices are strongest at the local and state level.

      <h1> Legislative Issues</h1>
State and federal legislation past and present that could affect homeschoolers in Massachusetts.      
      <h2>August 2014</h2>
      <p>July 31, 2014 saw the formal end of the current legislative session. None of the bills that AHEM has been tracking moved out of committee. The current legislative session will end in December. It is unlikely these bills will have any more activity, as the energy of the legislature turns to fall elections, and the House and Senate meet only in informal sessions. As of January 6, 2015, any bill that has not passed into law will be considered “dead.”  The sponsor of the bill will have to re-file the bill during the next legislative session if the bill is to be reconsidered.</p>
      <h2>March 2014</h2>
      <p>AHEM continues to monitor bills pending in the 188th Legislative Session for any action taken on education bills that may have an impact on Massachusetts homeschoolers.  </p>
      <p>The current session began in January 2013 and runs for two years.  On Tuesday, March 4, 2014, the Joint Committee on Education held an Executive Session.* S 208, AN ACT RELATIVE TO DROPOUT PREVENTION AND RECOVERY, was reported favorably out of committee, was given its first reading, and has now been referred to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means for further review. <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/188/Senate/S208" target="_blank">You can see the full text of the bill, bill history, and petitioners here</a>. </p>
      <p>S 208 was accompanied by H338, H341, H350, H368, H376, H523, H524, H525, H3290 and S283. </p>
      <p>S 208 would amend both Chapters 69 and 76 of the General Laws with the “age 18” attendance requirement and further establish tracking and coaching programs to identify and help students at risk of dropping out of high school. AHEM is opposed to this bill and sent a letter to be included in the official testimony for the hearing, which was held on October 8, 2013. We wrote, in summary: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Raising the compulsory attendance age would be ineffective in reducing the dropout rate. In fact, statistics demonstrate that states requiring attendance until age sixteen have a lower dropout rate than those states compelling attendance until ages seventeen or eighteen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Raising the compulsory attendance age would result in increased spending for school departments. Furthermore, raising the age would take away resources from potentially effective remedies to reduce the dropout age in favor of increased costs for teachers’ salaries, classrooms, and transportation. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>          Additionally, we are concerned that raising the age to 18 could remove alternatives, such as early graduation, from motivated students for whom traditional public school is not working.        </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>          If you share our concern, you can write to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Because the Ways and Means Committee is charged with considering all matters relating to the finances of the Commonwealth, we recommend the following talking point: <em>Since raising the compulsory attendance age would not result in a higher rate of high school completion, the financial burden to taxpayers and already fiscally strapped school departments cannot be justified.</em> This is a universal concern, and will carry the most weight. Please let AHEM know if you reach out, and what response if any you receive.  </p>
<p>We are not aware of any movement in the rest of the bills we have been following that could affect Massachusetts homeschoolers. </p>
      <p class="TableFont"><em> *“An Executive Session is a committee meeting during which the committee members decide upon the report type to be filed with a clerk for consideration by the larger body and (if discharge, favorable, study or extension) to which branch the report will be submitted.” [<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Site/Glossary" target="_blank">https://malegislature.gov/Site/Glossar</a>] </em></p>
<h2>DECEMBER 2013</h2>
      <p>AHEM continues to monitor bills pending in the 188th Legislative Session for any action taken on education bills that may impact Massachusetts homeschoolers.  The current session began in January 2013 and runs for two years.  The Legislature has held hearings on many of the bills summarized below but has not yet taken significant action on the bills concerning compulsory attendance age.  It has consolidated some of the bills concerning MCAS testing and other educational expenses and recommended studies of those costs.  We will likely see further activity on all of these bills in the new year.
      </p>
      <h6>BILLS CONCERNING HIGH SCHOOL TESTING AND GRADUATION</h6>
<p><strong>H 3723</strong> – Joint Committee on Education; AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO THE MCAS EXAM 	This bill is a redraft of H 432, which had sought to amend Chapter 69 to allow a non-public school student to elect to take the MCAS exam at that student’s own expense.  The redrafted H 3723 instead directs the Department of Education to issue a report within six months to the Legislature “on the feasibility and costs associated with non-public school students and <strong>home schooled students</strong> in grade 10 voluntarily taking” the MCAS exam. On 10/28/13 the Joint Education Committee reported H 3723 favorably (recommended its passage) and referred it to the House Ways and Means Committee for review.   </p>
</p>
<p><strong>H 504</strong> – Rep. Benjamin Sawn, D. Springfield; AN ACT TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THE MCAS FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION This bill would eliminate the MCAS or other state-developed, standardized test, as a component of the competency determination for high school graduation.  This bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Education on 1/22/13. A hearing was held on 4/9/13 but no further action has been taken. </p>
      <p><strong>H 348</strong> – Rep. Antonio Cabral, D. New Bedford; AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A NEW HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA 	This bill would amend Chapter 69, Section 1D to allow students who pass the MCAS to receive a “Commonwealth Diploma issued by the state Department of Education. Students who have demonstrated competency under this section by meeting the academic standards and curriculum frameworks enumerated in this section by satisfying the requirements of their local school committee shall be granted a Horace Mann Diploma issued by the local school committee. Students may receive either one or both diplomas. Issuance of either the Commonwealth or the Horace Mann Diploma to a student will certify that a student has met the competency determination described in this section and will entitle a student to all the rights and privileges of high school graduation.” This bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Education on 1/22/13 and a hearing was held on 4/9/13.  H 348 now accompanies H 453, S 219, and H 385, which all seek to provide a method for determining educational competence (including for students with learning disabilities).  The bills were reported favorably by the Joint Education Committee on 10/28/13 and referred to the House Ways and Means Committee for review.      </p>
      <h6>BILL IMPOSING MORATORIUM ON EDUCATION EXPENSES</h6>
      <p><strong> H 3722</strong> – Joint Committee on Education  	This bill is a redraft of H 373 and several other bills regarding educational funding.  H 373 had sought to impose a moratorium on newly mandated education programs and expenses until July 1, 2015.    H 3722 seeks to create a new task force to review existing educational mandates and reporting requirements for school districts and advise the Legislature regarding which mandates may be consolidated or eliminated as outdated.  Further, “Prior to issuing its recommendations, the task force shall conduct at least one public hearing to receive testimony from members of the public.”  On 10/28/13 the Joint Education Committee reported the bill favorably and referred it to the House Ways and Means Committee for review.      </p>
      <h6>KINDERGARTEN REQUIREMENTS</h6>
      <p><strong>        H 349</strong> – Rep.
