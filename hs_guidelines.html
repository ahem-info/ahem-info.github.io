		   <h1>Homeschool Guidelines at a Glance</h1>
		   <h2>SCHOOL AUTHORITY OVERSIGHT</h2>
               <p>Oversight of home education is a local function in Massachusetts. Because there are nearly as many ways to homeschool as there are homeschooling families, local oversight  enables school authorities to exercise discretion and flexibility in evaluating  home education plans and student progress. In using their oversight function, school authorities may ask for certain types of information (elaborated below), but they must remember the limits established to protect parents&rsquo; rights in  determining how their children will be educated.</p>
               <blockquote><q>…the approval of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on requirements that are not essential to the State interest in assuring that <q>all the children shall be educated.</q></q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>)</blockquote>
               <blockquote><q>…the  State…cannot apply institutional standards to this non-institutionalized  setting.</q> (<em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em>)</blockquote>
               <p>The courts have emphasized consistently that parents and school authorities should proceed cooperatively to <q>expedite approval.</q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a>, Searles, <a href="ivan.html">Ivan</a></em>) In cases where differences  cannot be resolved cooperatively, the school authority assumes the burden of  proof in any subsequent legal proceedings.</p>
               <h2>RESPONSIBILITIES OF SCHOOL AUTHORITIES AND PARENTS</h2>
               <h3>SCHOOL AUTHORITY'S RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
                 <ol class="nestedordered">
                   <li>Enforce the compulsory attendance law (G.L c. 76 Sec. 1).</li>
                   <li>Expedite approval of home education plans that meet the statutory standard.</li>
              </ol>
                 <h3>PARENTS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
              <ol class="nestedordered">
			   <li>Give prior notification to school authorities of their home education plan, which equals the local public school&rsquo;s <q>in thoroughness and  efficiency,</q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>);</li>
			   <li>Comply with an evaluation program mutually agreed upon by school and  parents.</li>
			 </ol>
               <h2>APPROVAL AND EVALUATION</h2>
             <ol class="nestedordered">
               <li>School officials  may ask for information regarding <q>qualifications of the parent or parents  who will be instructing the children,</q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>) but the parents are  not required to have any specific educational credentials. <q>General Laws  c. 71, Sec. 1, provides that teachers shall be <q>of competent ability and good  morals.</q></q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>)</li>
               <li>School officials  may inquire about subjects the child will study, length of the homeschool year,  and hours of instruction in each subject. While school officials may consider  hours of instruction in each subject, they may not dictate the manner in which  the subjects will be taught. (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>)  In practice this means that parents may calculate hours of instruction based on  the manner in which they homeschool, which does not have to replicate the  public school&rsquo;s offering, only equal it in <q>thoroughness and  efficiency.</q> Additionally, following a schedule is not an important  consideration in a home school where <q>...the perception and use of time...  are different.</q> (<em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em>)</li>
               <li>School officials  may identify teaching materials, but <q>only to determine subject and grade  level… school officials may not... use this access to dictate the manner in  which the subjects will be taught.</q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>) The Brunelle Court  pointed out that <q>…some of the most effective curricular materials…may not  be tangible. For example, travel, community service, visits to educationally  enriching facilities and places, and meeting with various resource people, can  provide important learning experiences apart from the four corners of a text or  workbook.</q> (<em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em>)</li>
               <li>School officials  and parents should agree on a method of evaluation that may include one of the  following approaches: standardized testing, periodic progress report, or dated  work samples. (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em>)  Home visits may not be required as a condition of approval. (<em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em>)</li>
