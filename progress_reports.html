		   <h1>Progress Reports</h1>
		   <p>In Massachusetts,  homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for  evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html">CARE  AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399 Mass. 324 (1987)</a> clearly  outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of  the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as  periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the  parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to  fulfill their responsibility.</p>
		   <p><em>Charles</em> is clear that parents are the instructors  and it is appropriate and acceptable for parents to evaluate their students&rsquo;  progress. AHEM&rsquo;s research shows that almost half of Massachusetts homeschoolers  choose to submit a progress report, making it the most popular choice.</p>
		   <p>AHEM has  heard from homeschoolers in various districts where school officials are  hesitant to accept the authority of evaluations by parents. In these cases,  schools request standardized test scores, extensive work samples, third party  evaluations, or a parent-produced progress report combined with a second form  of evaluation, such as work samples.</p>
		   <p>While school  officials in the professionalized world of education may not want to accept  parental evaluations as valid, the law in Massachusetts clearly allows parental  evaluation. Homeschooling parents who want to choose a progress report as their  form of evaluation need not be intimidated by demands for more.</p>
               <p>Here&rsquo;s one example  of a way that a district might question your authority to evaluate the  education of your children: In some districts, school officials create forms to  facilitate their responsibility for homeschool oversight. Sometimes, the list  of evaluation choices offered doesn&rsquo;t include <q>progress report,</q> but may or may  not include <q>other.</q> Homeschoolers can either write in <q>progress report</q> under  the <q>other</q> category, or create an <q>other</q> category and write in <q>progress  report.</q></p>
           <p>Some districts send  out <q>conditional</q> approval letters stating that the education plan approval is  <q>conditioned</q> on the submission of extra forms of evaluation. The response to  such a letter could be based on various factors including the homeschooling  family's past experience with the district, or the school official's track  record with homeschoolers. One response could be to do nothing and submit the  evaluation outlined in the original plan. Another option could be to respond  with a letter thanking the school for the approval and reiterating that the  form of evaluation outlined in the original plan will be submitted at the  appropriate time.</p>
               <p>Individual  circumstances play a big role when determining how to respond to requests from  school officials. As always, <a href="one-on-one.html">AHEM representatives</a> are available to talk through  options.</p>
               <p class="footnote"><em>This legal  summary was not drafted by practicing lawyers and is not intended to constitute  official legal advice, but rather is presented by AHEM volunteers and is based  on their reading and understanding of Massachusetts homeschooling requirements  as they have followed those requirements throughout the years. Readers still  need to make their own decision on how best to proceed.</em></p>
