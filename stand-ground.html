		   <h1>Homeschoolers Stand Their Ground</h1>
		   <p>Longtime Massachusetts homeschooling parents  Julia B. and Jeff C. experienced a pothole in their previously smooth dealings  with local school officials. Since homeschooling regulation in our state is  governed by case law which is flexible, open to interpretation, and  administered by local school districts, across the board guidelines do not  exist. A disadvantage of this setup is that new or existing school personnel  can change local policy at the drop of a hat. But policies are not law, only  tools to aid the schools in their oversight function. Homeschoolers do not have  to comply with policies that exceed the case law. The flexibility <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> (1987)  offers, and its encouragement to parents and schools to negotiate and find  agreements that work for the family while ensuring the state's interest, puts  homeschoolers in a good position to resolve disputes with their school  districts amicably.</p>
		   <p>When Julia and Jeff received the letter demanding more evaluative  materials than they had ever submitted before, it understandably created worry,  anxiety, and concern. But what might appear to be a Massachusetts  homeschooler's worst nightmare turned out to be little more than a brief,  mildly unpleasant dream with a happy ending. The couple handled the situation  without hiring a legal professional. They consulted with <a href="one-on-one.html">AHEM representatives</a>,  as well as <a href="networking.html">homeschoolers in their area</a>, to address the crackdown. Ultimately,  though, they decided for themselves how to interact with their superintendent.  They were able to stand their ground, receive approval, and continue their  child-led homeschooling in the way they always had.</p>
		   <p>Following is a brief conversation with Julia offering insight into  her experience working with her local superintendent.</p>
               <h4>What elements of your school district's requests did you take  issue with?</h4><p>After submitting our usual education plan with progress  report, which for the first time excluded a long bibliography of library books,  they asked for work samples and a more detailed <q>curriculum.</q></p>
               <h4>Why did you object to this?</h4><p>We objected on the  basis that the progress report was all that was required, and that we were not  required to supply a detailed curriculum if our method of homeschooling didn't  allow for one.</p>
               <h4>What was your response?</h4><p>At first, Jeff called  back just to find out in person what the superintendent actually wanted without  committing us to anything. I was too nervous to call&mdash;afraid I'd put my foot  in it or overreact in anger unnecessarily. Then we wrote to her, citing <em>Charles</em> as  evidence we didn't need to submit more materials. We reminded her that the  kids' progress was our responsibility, but that she could see evidence of it  through the progress report. We cited a few examples to support this. We cited materials we would use, and reassured her about the topics that would be  covered, generally speaking, and the overall number of learning hours the kids  would meet or exceed. We also asked for future communications to be in writing.</p>
               <h4>What was the outcome?</h4>
           <p>She wrote a formal  letter back essentially saying, <q>Thank you for your letter with regards to  homeschooling regulations. Enclosed please find the School Committee policy and  highlighted plan requirements. I am following through on these guidelines. As  for the plan, the onus is yours to provide a plan with curricula guidelines,  books, and resources you will be using, hours spent, who will be doing the  teaching, and what methods of assessment will be employed. Consistent with our  policy, please provide me with what our policy outlines.</q> There were also  a couple of thank you's, etc., in there. She enclosed the town's School  Committee Policy on Home Instruction, which included some extralegal requests.</p>
           <p>I was pretty nervous. And I was angry. So I re-read <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> and <em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em>, and a <a href="law_made_easy.html">couple of the summaries</a>. I don't  understand a lot of legalese, so the summaries were helpful. I consulted  several people about our legal standing, because I was starting to feel  targeted. I talked with <a>AHEM representatives</a> about what could and could not be  required, trying to iron out those gray areas. And I started writing a lengthy  response, with input from several friends. </p>
           <p>Then one friend from my town called and said she thought the  superintendent wasn't as much hostile as a little dense. She pointed out that  the woman was handed down the policy, and was not instrumental in creating it.  While the woman was a big testing advocate and didn't <q>get</q>  homeschooling, my friend thought a less adversarial approach would probably  help move the approval process along. So we took that into consideration and  wrote a different answer back that carefully spelled out, in itemized form, how  the information we'd given answered her questions and requirements. It occurred  to us that she just couldn't glean the information from the prose form we'd originally  used and literally needed bulleted information to get it. Also, to allay any of  her fears that we might be trying to get away with something, we attached the  full <q>Library Books Read</q> list that we'd always included in prior  years. They are lists we keep anyway&mdash;I'd left them out to try and establish a  precedent for giving as little as possible, but my friend thought their absence  this year might have set up a red flag of concern to the superintendent. One  other factor was that this last letter got to the superintendent just before  the school year started. My friend felt that she wouldn't have time to do  anything but approve it anyway, and she was right! Within a couple of weeks the  whole town had their approval letters.</p>
           <h4>What advice do you have for Massachusetts homeschoolers facing  unreasonable requests from their school districts?</h4>
           <a href="networking.html"> Talk  with others in your town</a>, whenever possible, or in your support group. People  have lots of good ideas. Don't always listen to those who suggest you give in,  however, because there are often diplomatic ways around the problem.
