               		<p>CIVIL ACTION  commenced in the Superior Court Department on June 6, 1995.</p>
               		<p>The case was heard  by Richard E. Welch III, J., on motions for summary judgment.</p>
               		<p>The Supreme Judicial  Court granted an application for direct appellate review.</p>

               		<p>GREANEY, J. We  granted the plaintiffs' application for direct appellate review in this case to  consider the validity of a requirement of the school committee of Lynn that  conditioned approval of the plaintiffs' home education plans on home visits by  the superintendent or his representative to <q>observe and evaluate the  [home] instructional process.</q> A judge in the Superior Court considered  cross motions for summary judgment, Mass.</p>

                 	<p class="footnote"><sup>2</sup>The parties have designated the Lynn public schools as the defendant, noting  that the schools act through the school committee of Lynn, the superintendent  of schools, and other school officials and employees. We shall retain the same  designation.</p>

               		<p>R. Civ. P. 56 (a)  and (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), and granted the defendant's motion after  deciding that the home visit requirement was valid. We conclude that the  requirement is not essential to approval of the plaintiffs' home education  plans. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and order a declaration of the  parties' rights reflecting our conclusion.</p>
               		<p>The material facts  are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows. The plaintiffs, Michael  and Virginia Brunelle, are married and are the parents of five school-aged  children. The Brunelles moved to Lynn in 1993, and gave notice to school  officials that they intended to educate their children at home. Mrs. Brunelle  is certified to teach elementary education and Mr. Brunelle has a master's  degree in Christian education.</p>
               		<p>The plaintiffs,  Stephen and Lois J. Pustell, are married and are the parents of three  school-aged children. The Pustells, residents of Lynn, notified school  officials in 1991 that they intended to educate one of their daughters at home.  Mrs. Pustell is certified to teach elementary education, and Mr. Pustell is  certified to teach mathematics at the secondary school level.</p>
               		<p>In both the cases of  the Brunelles and the Pustells the school committee and other school officials  have examined their home education proposals and are satisfied with the  qualifications of the parents as teachers, the contents of the curricula and  instructional materials to be used, the arnount of time to be devoted to  instruction, and the student evaluation plans. In addition to obtaining prior  approval of these matters, the school committee also requires that parents who  wish to educate their children at home <q>allow the Superintendent (or  designee, i.e., the Principal) to periodically . . . observe and evaluate the instructional  process and to verify that the Home Instruction Plan is being implemented as  authorized by the Committee.</q> The plaintiffs refused to consent to these  observations and evaluations in their homes. They instituted this action  asserting that the requirement violates G. L. c. 76, § 1, and certain  provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution. The plaintiffs sought a  declaration that the school committee's policy to require home visits violates  their rights under Massachusetts law, and injunctive relief enforcing the  declaration.<sup>3</sup></p>

See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Charles</em>, 399 Mass. 324, 334 (1987), and cases cited.  See also<em> Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth</em>, 420 Mass. 749, 754  (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1067 (1996). This right is subject to the  State's interest in seeing that children in home education programs receive an  education. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Charles</em>, supra at 336.</p>
               		<p>We said in Care  &amp; Protection of Charles that <q>the approval of a home school  proposal must not be conditioned on requirements that are not essential to the  State interest in ensuring that <q>all the children shall be educated,</q></q> <em>id. at 337,</em> and that school officials <q>may enforce,  through the approval process under <em>G. L. c. 76, § 1,</em> certain reasonable  educational requirements similar to those required for public and private  schools</q> (emphasis added). <em>399 Mass. at 336</em>.&nbsp; We went on to suggest  guidelines for approval of home education plans. We indicated that school  officials could, among other matters, insist that required courses, as  enumerated in <em>G. L. c. 71, § 1.</em> be taught, as well as any other subjects  considered <q>expedient</q>; examine the competency of the teachers  (usually parents); consider the length of the school year and the hours of  instruction in each subject; insist that parents furnish school officials with  access to textbooks, workbooks, and other instructional aids, as well as to  lesson plans and teaching manuals, and employ periodic standardized testing or  other means of evaluating the children's progress. See <em>399 Mass. at  337-340.</em> As to the need for home visits, we said the following: “With  appropriate testing procedures or progress reports, there may be no need for  periodic on-site visits or</p>

See <em>Pustell v. Lynn Pub. Schs</em>., 18 F.3d 50, 53-55 (1st  Cir. 1994). In view of this decision, the plaintiffs brought the present  action, which is based exclusively on State law, and contains the plaintiffs'  express <q>reserv[ation of] all claims under federal law for the Federal  District Court.</q></p>

Ct.&nbsp; 1983)]</em> (upholding  requirement of on-site visits).” <em>399 Mass. at 340.</em> This passage left  unresolved whether home visits could be required in this type of case.</p>
               <p>We agree with the  plaintiffs that, with respect to the approval of home education plans for  children to be taught by parents that satisfy other pertinent criteria,  including those summarized above, a home visit is not presumptively essential  to protection of the State's interest in seeing that children receive an  education, and therefore, such visits may not be required as a condition to  approval of the plaintiffs' plans. As would be expected, all fifty States allow  for home education of children as an alternative to their attendance at a  public or other day school. Thirty-four States (and the District of Columbia)  have statutes or regulations that specifically acknowledge home education as a  distinct category of private education.<sup>4</sup> The remaining sixteen  States either include home schooling under a statute designed for church and  private schools,<sup>5</sup> or, as is the case in Massachusetts, permit  home education under their more general statutory sch<sup>6</sup> W.M.

           <p class="footnote"><sup>4</sup>See, e.g., <em>Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, §§  5001-A(3)(A)(3), 5021, 5022, 5023</em> (West 1993 &amp; 1998 Supp.) (compulsory  attendance in public schools required between the ages of seven and seventeen  years; home instruction specifically recognized as an &quot;equivalent  instruction alternative&quot;; approval of local school board and State  commissioner required, opportunities for part-time enrollment in public  school); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. c. 193-A (Michie Supp. 1997) (parents have the  right to home educate their own children, must notify local or State official,  and comply with minimum educational requirements; State has home education  program and home education advisory council).</p>

                 <p>country discloses  that the States have concluded that their interests can be satisfied if the  home education plan under examination complies with a list of requirements  which are similar to those described in <em>Care &amp; Protection of  Charles, supra</em>, including periodic assessment of the child's progress by  means of standardized testing or other alternatives that measure aptitude and  learning.<sup>7</sup> Only one State law that we can find requires home  schoolers to submit to home visits by school officials as a condition to  approval of home education plans. That law is designed to regulate private, denominational,  and parochial schools, and approval is based in part on &quot;health and safety  factors in buildings and grounds.&quot; Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 79-1601(2). 79-1605  (1996). Ohio's guidelines prohibit school officials from conducting home  visitations, Rhode Island does not allow school officials to require home  visits as a precondition of home education plan approval, and North Carolina  and New York have eliminated home visitations as conditions of approval. See  W.M. Gordon, Home Schooling, <em>supra</em> at 34-35 &amp; n. 122: Kindstedt  vs. East Greenwich School Comm., R.I. Comm'r of Educ. (Aug. 7, 1986); N.C. Gen.  Stat. § 115C-564 (Michie 1997); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, §  100.10(i)(3) (1995). In 1988, the New York State board of regents promulgated  new regulations governing home instruction. These regulations eliminated home  visits as a matter of course, a practice permitted by a lower New York court  decision in <em>Matter of Kilroy, supra</em>, instead &quot;authoriz[ing]  such visits only after a family's home-schooling program has been placed on  probation and the local Superintendent has 'reasonable grounds' to believe that  the program is not in compliance with state requirements.&quot; <em>Blackwelder  v. Safnauer</em>, 866 F.2d 548, 551-552 (2d Cir. 1989).8</p>

                 <p class="footnote"><sup>7</sup> Thirty-nine states require parents to notify the State or the  school district of their intent to home school their children. See W.M. Gordon,  Home Schooling 29 ( (1994) Only six States require advance approval of  education plans in addition to notification and many require compliance with  State time and curriculum mandates. See id. Comment, The Constitutionality of  State Home Schooling Statutes, 39 Vill. L Rev. 1309. 1346 (1994). Many States  focus on teacher qualifications, and those that group home schools with other  private schools require teacher certification. See id. Almost all States  require periodic assessment of home schooled students' academic progress. Id.</p>
                 <p class="footnote"><sup>8</sup> Thus, the decision by the Federal District Court in Blackwelder v.  Safnauer,</p>
               <h4>517</h4>
               <p>General Laws c. 76,  § 1, does not explicitly, or by implication contain a requirement for home  visits, but gives local school officials discretion to develop home school  approval guidelines. We cannot say whether home visits are commonly required by  local school officials, but view such a requirement carefully in light of  constitutional considerations.</p>
               <p>The school  committee's requirement of home visits is explained in the &quot;Home  Instruction - Regulations&quot; as being necessary to &quot;allow the  Superintendent (or designee, i.e., the Principal) to periodically . . . observe  and evaluate the instructional process and to verify that the Home Instruction  Plan is being implemented as authorized by the Committee.&quot; The home visit  policy was justified by the superintendent of schools in his deposition  testimony in the following manner:</p>
               <blockquote><q>I believe when  we adopted the policy I recommended to the School Committee that it was  essential that we visit the homes to make sure that the plan is being  implemented, that there is an instructional space available, that there are  materials present, that there was a schedule that is followed, and my  understanding when I recommended it was that we were really concerned about the  process and outcomes, not just the outcomes, but the process, too.</q></blockquote>
               <p>These reasons have  to be measured against the nature of the home education involved in the  plaintiffs' case (namely, parents teaching their children in their own home)  which in certain important ways can never be the equivalent of in-school  education. For example, at home, there are no other students (except perhaps  siblings), no classrooms, and no rigid schedules. Parents who teach at home  stand in a very different relationship to their children than do teachers to a  class full of other peoples' children. Teaching methods may be less formalized,  but in the home setting may be more effective than those used in the classroom  because the teacher-to-student ratio is maximized, a factor permitting close  communication and monitoring on an individualized basis. It is obvious from  these differences that, while the State can insist that the child's education  be moved along in a way which can be objectively measured, it cannot apply  institutional standards to this noninstitutionalized setting.</p>
               
                 <hr class="hrfootnote">
               
               <p class="footnote">689 F. Supp. 106  (N.D.N.Y. 1988), which upheld the requirement of home visits in New York, is  similar to the decision in Matter of Kilroy, 121 Misc. 2d 98 (N.Y. Ct.1983).  The matter is now governed by the regulations.</p>
		   <h4>518</h4>
               <p>Furthermore, a  requirement of home visits may call into play issues of family privacy in  seeking to keep the home free of unwarranted intrusion.</p>
               <p>We are not persuaded  that the reasons given by the superintendent, although articulated by him in  good faith, are sufficient to justify home visits as an essential condition to  the home education plans in question. While following a schedule may be an  important consideration in a public school where preexisting schedules need to  be maintained and coordinated, the perception and use of time in a home school  are different. The plaintiffs can observe and accommodate variations (from  child to child, subject to subject, day to day) in the learning process and  teach through a process that paces each student. The results of their teaching  programs can be adequately verified through testing without the need to visit  the home to see if a formal schedule is being followed. Additionally, the  school committee, if desired, can ask the plaintiffs to submit periodic reports  on the progress of each child's education in order to indicate what subjects,  areas, and materials have been learned and what is planned for the next  reporting period.</p>
               <p>Similarly, it is not  essential to visit the plaintiffs' homes to see if &quot;there are materials  present.&quot; The plaintiffs can be asked to identify the teaching materials  that will be used, and even to show them, if appropriate, to school officials.  It should not be overlooked in this regard, that some of the most effective  curricular materials that the plaintiffs may use may not be tangible. For  example, travel, community service, visits to educationally enriching  facilities and places, and meeting with various resource people, can provide  important learning experiences apart from the four corners of a text or  workbook.</p>
               <p>We also do not consider  essential the perceived need to verify that &quot;there is an instructional  space available&quot; in the plaintiffs' homes. The entire home is apparently  in each case available to the plaintiffs' children, and whether their  educational plans are appropriate should not depend on the size of their  kitchen tables or their students' desks. We doubt that parents like the  plaintiffs, who are so committed to home education that they are willing to  forgo the public schools, and devote substantial time and energy to teaching  their children, will let the children's progress suffer for lack of adequate  instructional space.</p>
               <p>Both the United  States Supreme Court and this court have emphasized, in connection with the  protected right of parents to</p>
               <h4>519</h4>
               <p>raise their  children, that <q>government may not intrude unnecessarily on familial  privacy.</q> <em>Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth</em>, 420 Mass. 749,  756 &amp; n.8 (1995), and cases cited. This concern (as well as others)  dictates, as we said in the <em>Curtis</em> case, that home education  proposals can be made subject only to essential and reasonable requirements.  The home visits sought to be imposed on the education proposals of the  plaintiffs are not essential. We express no opinion on whether home visits can  be required (as appears to be the case in New York during any period of  probation) if a child is not making satisfactory progress under a home  education plan, if a home is used to educate children from other families, or  if other circumstances make such a requirement essential, and reasonable  standards are formulated to enforce the requirement.</p>
               <p>Because our decision  rests on G. L. c. 76, § 1, as interpreted in <em>Care &amp; Protection of  Charles</em>, 399 Mass. 324 (1987), there is no need to consider the several  arguments made by the plaintiffs under the Massachusetts Constitution. We also  need not address their argument that the requirement is a disguised effort to  perform unwarranted teacher evaluations. The judgment is vacated. A new  judgment is to be entered declaring that the school committee of Lynn and other  school officials cannot, in the absence of consent, require home visits, as a  condition to the approval of the plaintiffs' home education plans, and that, if  those plans continue to comply with the standards for home education, they are  to be approved.9</p>
               <p><em>So ordered.</em></p>
               
                 <hr class="hrfootnote">
               
               <p class="footnote"><sup>9</sup> There is no reason to order injunctive  relief because it is clear that the school committee and school officials will  comply with the terms of the declaration.</p>
