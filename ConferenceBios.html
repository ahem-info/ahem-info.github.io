After being laid-off from a start-up within days of his first daughter being born, he decided to run with it and became a stay-at-home-dad while doing some consulting on the side. When it was time to enter kindergarten, the family decided to give homeschooling a shot, since both Cade and his wife (a physics PhD from Berkeley) felt that their own elementary-school years were largely a waste of time. Everyone loved the way it worked out, and the family has never looked back, using the freedom granted to let his two daughters pursue their own interests extensively and supplementing their education with extended travel across the country and around the globe. After moving back to the Boston area in 2010, Cade and his daughters (now 8 and 10) have gradually become integrated into the vibrant and diverse local homeschool community.</p></td>

She is an advocate at heart and, in addition to working with vulnerable populations, for the past seven years she has made it a point to reach out to others looking at home education as well as to strongly encourage people in general to question the status quo. She has been working with AHEM for almost four years and has been on the Board for two.
          Cindy enjoys meeting people, singing, walking in the woods, writing, hanging with family and friends, playing games, reading with her girls, road trips, and exploring the new and enriching things that life has to offer.</p></td>
