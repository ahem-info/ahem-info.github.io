		   <h1>Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Approved! Or Not?</h1>
		   <p>Your education plan is submitted, all your ducks are in a row, and your homeschooling year is well underway. The only problem is, you haven’t received an approval letter from your district. Is that a problem? Information collected over the past decade for the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=lwP373yb5gBQFElJgDNE7A_3d_3d">AHEM Policy and Practice Database</a> shows that it’s not uncommon for districts to never send approval letters. In these cities and towns, homeschoolers simply go about the business of educating their  children as outlined in their education plan, with no issues.</p>
		   <p>Maybe you have received a letter, but the language makes it hard to discern whether it&rsquo;s actually an approval letter. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by formal or provisional language such as &ldquo;preliminary approval&rdquo; or &ldquo;pending reviews of progress.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s common for schools to use this kind of language in approval letters.</p>
           <p>Below are some tips and options about how to handle the fact that receiving official notification of approval is not guaranteed:</p>
               <ul class="nested">
                 <li>Send your education plan &ldquo;Return Receipt Requested&rdquo; or hand deliver it and ask for a signed receipt. Either option provides verification  that your materials were received.</li>
                 <li>If you don&rsquo;t receive an approval letter, and you feel concerned about the lack of response from the school, check with other homeschoolers in  your town. You may find out that it&rsquo;s routine for your district not to provide formal approval. If a letter is important to you or necessary, you can request  one.</li>
                 <li>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need an approval letter to take advantage of educator discounts available to homeschoolers. Many museums and stores allow homeschoolers to self-certify.</li>
                 <li>If you did receive a letter and have questions about it, <a href="one-on-one.html">AHEM's contacts</a><a href="one-on-one.html"></a> are available.</li>
               </ul>
