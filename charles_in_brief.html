		   <h1>Charles, in Brief</h1>
		   <p>In Massachusetts, there is no statutory scheme that deals  specifically with the approval of home education plans (statutes are laws  passed by the legislative branch of government). While there are some statutes  that concern all <q>school age</q> children, (e.g. the compulsory  attendance statute), the approval of home education plans in Massachusetts is  guided by the legal principles and guidelines set forth in the <em>Charles</em> decision  (known as case law, since decided by the judicial branch of government). AHEM  strongly recommends that anyone homeschooling their children, or interested in  homeschooling their children, read <a href="charles.html"><em>Charles</em></a> in its  entirety. To pique your interest, we have prepared a summary of the <em>Charles</em> case,  detailing those points most relevant to our concerns as homeschoolers.</p>
		   <p>The issue before the <em>Charles</em> court was how  to accommodate the rights of parents under the US and Massachusetts  Constitutions with the governmental interest in the education of its citizens.</p>
               <p>In August 1985, the <em>Charles</em> parents  notified the Canton school officials that they would be homeschooling their  three children. In September, the parents presented their proposal at a school  committee meeting. School committee members voiced their concerns about certain  aspects of the proposal, including the parents' objection to school department  testing and evaluation of the children's progress. The committee asked the  parents to prepare a more detailed proposal since they hoped to make a decision  at the October school committee meeting.</p>
               <p>The father met with the school superintendent prior to the  October school committee meeting. At that time, he refused to detail the  educational background of himself and his wife. He refused to provide the  school department with the number of hours and days that would be devoted to  instruction. He also refused to allow a home visit by school officials. The  father did agree to provide copies of the tables of contents of the curriculum  materials when they arrived, and did state his preference for using a  particular standardized test.</p>
               <p>The parents declined to attend the October school committee  meeting, asserting they had no additional information for the school committee.  The school committee prepared a memorandum of agreement, and sent this to the  parents, saying if the parents signed the memorandum, it would facilitate the  school committee's consideration of their proposal. The parents returned an  unsigned edited version of the agreement.</p>
               <p>At the November school committee meeting, the members voted  to accept the recommendation of the school superintendent that the parents be  denied permission to homeschool their children for the following reasons:</p>
             <ol class="nestedordered">  
			 <li>Superintendent had not been given reason to believe the  parents were competent to teach their children.</li>
               <li>The parents had indicated that their children would be  spending less time on formal instruction than the public schools.</li>
               <li>The parents objected to the school's efforts to  monitor/observe the instructional methods, and periodically test the children  to determine whether they were making reasonable progress.</li>
               <li>The school department initiated truancy proceedings, and  filed a petition for care and protection of the children. In May 1986 a judge  found that the children were in need of care and protection with respect to  educational care, and ordered the children to school. The parents retained both  legal and physical custody of the children. The parents appealed the judge's  order to the Appeals Court, and the Supreme Judicial Court took the case on its  own motion. While the appeal was pending, the lower court's decision requiring  the children to go to school was stayed, and the children were NOT sent to  school.</li>
		   </ol>
               <p>The Supreme Judicial Court heard the case, and in March 1987  decided the following:</p>
             <ol class="nestedordered">  
			 <li>The school committee was the proper party in maintaining  a care and protection proceeding.</li>
               <li>A school committee's process of approval of a home  education plan is to be governed by the same body of law as the approval of a  private school. (Mass. General Laws, Chapter 76, section 1) <q>School  committees shall approve a private school when satisfied that the instruction  in all the studies required by law equal in thoroughness and efficiency, that  in the public school in the same town.</q></li>
               <li>Approval must be obtained in advance, i.e. prior to  removal of the child(ren) from school. However, the court goes on to say that  if the parents commence the education of their children at home in the face of  the school committee's refusal to approve the parents' home school proposal,  the burden of proof shifts to the school committee to show that <q>the  instruction outlined in the proposal fails to equal in thoroughness and  efficiency, and in the progress made therein, that in the public schools in the  same town.</q></li>
               <li>The court recognized certain factors that may be  considered in determining whether to approve a home education plan. The four  factors are:</li>
				 <ol class="nestedordered2">
               <li>Proposed curriculum and number of hours of instruction in  each of the proposed subjects, noting that the public schools are required to  operate for a minimum of 180 days.</li>
               <li>Competency of parents to teach their children. The school  officials may inquire as to academic credentials and other qualifications. The  court noted that parents need not be certified, nor must they have college or  advanced academic degrees.</li>
               <li>Superintendent or school committee may have access to  textbooks, workbooks, and other instructional aids, and to lesson plans and  teaching manuals, to determine the types of subjects to be taught, and the  grade level of instruction for comparison purposes with the curriculum of the  public schools. They may not use this access to dictate the manner in which the  subjects will be taught.</li>
               <li>Superintendent or school committee may properly require  periodic evaluation to ensure educational progress and attainment of minimum  standards. Means of evaluating progress may be standardized testing, periodic  progress reports, or dated work samples. The <em>Charles</em> court, in  their decision, required the parents and school officials to work together in  trying to reach agreement on the issues in dispute. Based on this, it is likely  that the court preference would be that parents and school officials work to  reach an agreement on the method of evaluation to be used. In negotiations with  schools around testing, parties should keep in mind the court’s mandate that  any condition of approval meet the standard of “essential.” School officials  may not require home visits as a condition for approval (later decided by  the <em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em> court).</li>
			   </ol>
				 </ol>
               <p>The Supreme Judicial Court vacated the lower court decision  and required all parties to proceed expeditiously in a serious effort to  resolve the matter by agreement, now having the legal principles and guidelines  set forth in <em>Charles</em> to guide them. It is notable that the  court said, <q>We conclude that the interests of all will be best served [if  the parties] proceed expeditiously in a serious effort to resolve the matter by  agreement.</q></p>
               <p>So, in addressing the basic issue before the court, i.e. how  to reconcile the rights of parents under the US and Massachusetts Constitutions  with the governmental interest in the education of its citizens, the Court  seemed to say that while parents of school age children have the basic  constitutional right to educate their children, the school committee of the  town in which they reside could protect the State's interest in the education  of its citizens by enforcing, through the approval process, reasonable  requirements. However, the Court said, <q>Having concluded that the approval  process, under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 76, section 1, is  constitutionally permissible, we caution the superintendent or school committee  that the approval of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on  requirements that are not essential to the State's interest in ensuring that  <q>all children shall be educated.</q></q></p>
               <p>The approval of home education plans in Massachusetts  continues to be guided by the principles set forth in this decision. The <q>equal in thoroughness and efficiency</q> standard is still used by  school officials in evaluating plans. The court sanctioned factors that may be  considered by superintendents or school committees in evaluating a home  education plan continue to be the only factors school officials may take into  account when evaluating a home education plan.</p>
