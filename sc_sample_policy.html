		   <h1 align="center">HOME EDUCATION POLICY</h1>
		   <p>The [TOWN] Public School Committee recognizes and respects the right of  parents or guardians to educate their children at home. The school committee appreciates  the personal and cultural uniqueness of each family and desires to ensure that the  process by which school officials are notified of and review home education  programs is both lawful and equitable. Therefore, the school committee  established this home education policy:</p>
		   <p>Parent(s) or guardian(s) planning to undertake a home education program  for their child(ren) between their sixth and sixteenth birthday shall submit an  education plan to the superintendent [or appropriate administrator] prior to  commencing a home education program. </p>
         <p>Home education programs shall be considered in an equitable, objective,  and timely manner. Factors that may be considered by the superintendent or  school committee are:</p>
         
         <ol class="nestedordered">
           <li>The academic credentials or other qualifications  of parent(s) or guardian. Home educators need not be certified teachers nor  have any diplomas or degrees.</li>
           <li>An overview of the educational program including  subjects and instructional materials. In order to meet the specific educational  needs of their child(ren), the home educator(s) may adjust the material to  achieve the goals of the educational program without further notification to  the superintendent&rsquo;s office.</li>
           <li>A statement concerning instructional hours that  will be followed.</li>
           <li>The home educator(s) will choose one method of  assessment to be submitted annually. This method, which corresponds to the type  of education program, will be one of the following:</li>
           <ul class="nested">
             <li>Progress report</li>
             <li>Dated work samples</li>
             <li>Standardized test results</li>
             <li>Any other method agreed to by both superintendent  and home educator(s) </li>
           </ul>
         </ol>
         <p>A student being educated in a home-based program within the District  may have access to public school activities of either a curricular or  extracurricular nature upon approval of the Superintendent.</p>
         <p>Home educator(s) are entitled to all due process rights with regard to  this policy and with regard to any procedures followed and actions taken.  During any resolution process, the parent(s) or guardian(s) may educate their  children at home.</p>
         <p>LEGAL REF.: <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter76/Section1" target="_blank">M.G.L. 76:1</a>; <em><a href="charles.html">Care and Protection of Charles</a></em></p>

         <p>[Please note: <em>School districts are not required to have a written homeschool policy. </em>If your district wishes to adopt a formal policy, this one covers the essentials and is a good starting point. School officials should confer with local counsel to make sure any policy is in accordance with statutory and case law.]</p>
