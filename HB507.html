      <h1>House Bill 507</h1>
        <h2>Update March 2008 </h2>
      HB 507, &quot;An Act Relative to Homeschooling&quot; and HB 523, &quot;An Act Permitting Non Public School Students to take MCAS Exam&quot; have become part of HB 4530. This bill gives the DOE responsibility for investigating the feasibility and costs associated with allowing non-public school and homeschool students to voluntarily be allowed to take MCAS in grade 10. The DOE will report their findings by November 15th, 2008. We have included the full text HB 4530 below.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;AN ACT PERMITTING NON PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS TO TAKE MCAS EXAM. <br />
          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: <br />
        The Department of Education shall issue a report, not later than November 15, 2008, on the feasibility and costs associated with non-public school students and home schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily taking the MCAS exam at a non-public school site; and provided further, that said report shall be provided to the secretary of administration and finance, the secretary of education, the chair of the house ways and means committee, the chair of the senate ways and means committee, the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on education.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
      <p>In MA law, homeschoolers are referred to as &quot;otherwise instructed&quot; in the compulsory attendance statute, Chapter 76, section 1. AHEM has contacted the Research Director of the Education committee, Nate Mackinnon, to ask that the term &quot;home schooled&quot; either be replaced with the term &quot;otherwise instructed&quot; or left out completely if otherwise instructed students are considered as &quot;non-public school students.&quot; Mr. Mackinnon is going to check with counsel about whether changing the term is advisable (it may not be necessary since the bill does not amend a statute), but if it is, they will change the terminology. He says the intent in including it was a gesture to assure homeschoolers they were not being overlooked as a population, should voluntarily taking the MCAS become an option.</p>
      <p>
      <h2>Thoughts on HB 507 </h2>
        HB 507, a bill filed by Rep. Paul Loscocco (Republican - Eighth Middlesex), has been assigned to the Education committee. The bill would amend Section 1I of chapter 69 of the general laws. The bill refers to students who are &quot;otherwise instructed.&quot; Since homeschoolers in Massachusetts fall under the category of &quot;otherwise instructed&quot; in the Massachusetts general laws, this bill would affect homeschoolers. While the text of the bill refers to private and parochial students as well as to otherwise instructed students, the title of the bill says, &quot;Home Schooling.&quot;
        <h6>The bill (text below) would</h6>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> require schools to allow homeschoolers and private school students residing in their district to take the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
  <p>allow use of public funds to pay for the administration of the test;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>require schools to award diplomas to homeschoolers who pass MCAS and request a diploma;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>allow schools to offer &quot;remedial&quot; help for homeschoolers who &quot;fail… to meet the requirements of the competency determination;&quot;</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <h2>AHEM's position</h2>
        As parents who have chosen to &quot;otherwise educate&quot; our children, we feel this bill is unnecessary, and could possibly create problems for homeschoolers in exchange for dubious benefit.</p>
      <p>
<h6>In reading the bill, we find some grey areas to consider:</h6>
      </p>
      <p>        <strong>This bill could create administrative confusion for homeschoolers and school officials.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Is this bill asking for special treatment of homeschoolers</strong> by requiring schools to issue diplomas based solely on passing MCAS, thereby rendering local graduation requirements meaningless? Or would superintendents feel the need to fulfill their mandate to assure that every student receiving a high school diploma in their district fulfills local graduation requirements, which include coursework as well as a passing grade on the MCAS, and so make excessive demands on homeschoolers?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>How might the requirement that schools issue diplomas to homeschoolers who pass the MCAS affect the expectations schools have for all homeschoolers</strong> in their district, any of whom may decide to opt for the exam at some future date? Would approval of plans become tied to how closely they are aligned to the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks? Would superintendents feel obligated to disapprove of future homeschool plans for homeschooled students who have failed MCAS?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>How might superintendents respond to homeschoolers who fail the exam,</strong>given that the current text of the bill appears to allow the school to decide whether to provide a remedial plan to a homeschooled student who fails MCAS? Although the bill allows private and parochial students to take MCAS, those students are not included in the section that addresses remedial plans.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Other concerns:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>According to the Massachusetts Department of Education, <strong>&quot;…the MCAS tests, … are designed to measure the academic progress of students enrolled in publicly supported schools and the performance of those schools.&quot;</strong> The MCAS is intended to reflect how well actual schools are performing in implementing the frameworks outlined in the Education Reform Act of 1993, as well as to assess whether individual students are being educated sufficiently through the application of the frameworks. Might using a test that was created for these very specific purposes as nothing more than a hoop to jump through to be issued a diploma from a school the student did not actually attend feel to school officials like mocking the test and the system it is designed to evaluate? Might it create antagonism between homeschoolers and schools?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The federal <em>No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB),</em> requires public school students to fulfill a range of requirements for their school to be eligible for federal funding.</strong> These include the statewide MCAS exam; providing the same academic standards for all schools and children in the State; and &quot;adequate yearly progress,&quot; of which measurements include graduation rates for high schools and attendance rates for elementary and middle schools. Would it be a violation of NCLB to issue a diploma to students who may not have met all the federal requirements? Whether it actually is or not, will superintendents be confused and concerned about this in practice, and make homeschoolers' lives more difficult because of that confusion?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Whenever a bill is introduced, the possibility exists that it will be modified as it passes through the legislative process.</strong> In the current climate of high stakes testing and greater accountability, is it in homeschoolers' best interests to push for a bill that would require spending state and local time and money on homeschoolers, with no benefit to the public school system? Does this bill create an opportunity and justification for our legislature to demand greater regulation of homeschooling in Massachusetts?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Also consider:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>High school diplomas are not necessary for homeschoolers to pursue college or other goals</strong> in the majority of cases. For most of homeschooling history in Massachusetts, homeschoolers have gone on to pursue goals after homeschooling, including matriculating at selective universities, without diplomas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Most colleges are familiar with homeschooled applicants,</strong> and are primarily interested in their portfolios, the meat of the application, considering a high school diploma or GED a bureaucratic box to check off in some cases. It is wise to check with places of interest, such as candidate colleges, workplaces, or the military to find out what their acceptance and matriculation requirements are.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>High school diplomas are not necessary for federal financial aid.</strong> See <a href="FAFSA.html">Homeschoolers and Federal Student Aid</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>In cases where diplomas are required, alternatives to public high school diplomas are currently available to homeschoolers.</strong> The General Education Development Diploma (GED) already exists as a widely accepted credential, as well as other alternatives to public high school diplomas, such as parent issued diplomas, or enrollment in an umbrella school or a correspondence school that offers a diploma program. </p>
        </li>
        <li>          The GED is an appropriate test for students such as homeschoolers, who have embraced an alternative education style, to measure their knowledge and academic skills against those of today's traditional high school graduates. The GED Tests measure knowledge in five different areas: language arts, writing; social studies; science; reading; and mathematics. Statistics: About two-fifths of graduating high school seniors don't pass the tests under current score requirements. About one in twenty first-year college students is a GED graduate. (<a href="http://www.acenet.edu/clll/ged/index.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.acenet.edu/clll/ged/index.cfm</a>)        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to respond </h2>
      <p>      If you'd like to voice your opinion about this bill, the most effective thing you can do is to let your own state senator and representative know your position. (Find their names and contact info here:<a href="http://www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.php" target="_blank">www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.php</a>)</p>
<p>Best is a letter in your own words, but<strong> even just a phone call or email stating your position, no reason given, is better than saying nothing at all.</strong> If you write a letter, it can also help to copy your letter to the Chairs of the Joint committee on Education, Senator Robert Antonioni and Representative Patricia Haddad.</p>
      <p>If your senator or representative happens to be a member of the Joint committee on Education, then we urge you to take the extra time to write him or her a letter in your own words, as your opinion will carry more weight than the average Joe's.</p>
      <p>If you would send AHEM a copy of your letter, or just let us know that you've made your voice heard, we'd be most grateful. Please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:infor@ahem.info">info@ahem.info</a> or PO Box 1307, Arlington, MA 02474.</p>
      <p>
        <h2>Points to consider when formulating your thoughts: </h2>
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> HB 507places an administrative and fiscal burden on the public schools.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The MCAS is intended to reflect how well actual schools are performing in implementing the frameworks outlined in the Education Reform Act of 1993, as well as to assess whether individual students are being educated sufficiently through the application of the frameworks. The MCAS were developed for a specific purpose, one that is beyond the scope of homeschooling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Oversight of home education is a local function in Massachusetts, enabling school authorities to exercise discretion and flexibility in evaluating home education plans and student progress. This bill interferes with local oversight by requiring schools to issue diplomas to homeschoolers who pass the MCAS and request a diploma. We are concerned that this requirement could create administrative confusion for homeschoolers and school officials.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are the requirements of the bill in sync with the federal <em>No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB),</em> which requires public school students to fulfill a range of requirements for their school to be eligible for federal funding?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When we chose to homeschool, we did it with eyes open, making the decision to forego public high school diplomas in favor of the freedom that homeschooling allows us and our children.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          Most colleges are familiar with homeschooled applicants, who have chosen an alternative form of education. Diplomas are not necessary for college admission or to qualify for federal financial aid.        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The superintendent of every public school district in the commonwealth shall on or before October 15 each year notify in writing the headmaster of each private and parochial school and the parent or guardian of every student who is otherwise instructed within the district of the opportunity for said private or parochial school or otherwise instructed student voluntarily to participate in and with the statewide assessment of students in grades 4, 8, and 10 as authorized in section 1I of chapter 69; provided, however, that the results of any such assessment tests by private and parochial school students or of any student who is otherwise instructed shall not be used to evaluate the performance of any public school within the school district or the performance of the school district and all records of such results shall be collected and maintained separately by the department; provided further, however, that no public funds shall be expended by the public school district for any costs associated with the acquisition, distribution, or administration of said tests relative to any student of each such private and parochial school unless that student resides in the public school district where such private or parochial school is located. Any private or parochial school or the parents or guardians of any student attending any private or parochial school or of any student who is otherwise instructed electing to have any student participate in said testing shall notify the superintendent of the decision no later than November 15, with any such participation at all times to be voluntary.</p>
      <p>Any student who is otherwise instructed pursuant to this section and who requests a diploma from a public high school shall be required to satisfy the requirements of the competency determination established in section 1D of chapter 69 as a condition for receiving said diploma, which upon satisfaction of such requirements of competency determination shall be granted; provided, however, that the assessment instrument used to verify competency determination shall be given at state expense; and provided further that in the case of any student who is otherwise instructed and fails to meet the requirements of the competency determination, the school district may, but shall not be required to, provide a remedial plan as defined in subsection (i) of section 1D of chapter 69; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the rights of any student otherwise instructed who re-enrolls as a student within the public school district.      </p>
