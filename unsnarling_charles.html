		   <h1>Unsnarling Charles</h1>
		   <p>Understanding  Massachusetts homeschooling law is not a straightforward undertaking. Yet it is  an important one. Once you understand your rights, you can stand up for them.  Homeschooling in Massachusetts is a purely local undertaking, with each  district performing oversight functions. (The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove homeschooling plans, and in  fact plays no role whatsoever in the implementation of homeschooling regulation  in our state.) The following is our own interpretation of <em><a href="charles.html">Charles's</a></em> intent  regarding issues such as prior approval, written approval, evaluation, midyear  changes, and testing, and does not constitute legal advice; it is for  informational purposes only.</p>
		   <h2>PRIOR APPROVAL</h2>
		   <p>While it is true  that the compulsory attendance statute (<a href="chapter_76.html">Mass G.L. section 76, chapter 1</a>) requires  that approval be granted in advance of homeschooling, <em>Charles's</em> interpretation  of this is vague. The court in <em>Charles</em> found against the  family by determining that homeschool regulation is not unconstitutional in  Massachusetts. The basis for this determination comes from the Massachusetts  Constitution's statement that the state should <q>cherish</q> the  education of its citizenry. In the court's estimation, this means that the  state has an interest in the education of its citizenry that must be upheld.</p>
		   <p>At the same time,  the court acknowledged the constitutionally protected parental right to  homeschool. The <em>Charles</em> decision was written in an attempt to  balance these two interests: the state's interest in the education of its  citizenry and the parental right to homeschool. Prior approval of an education  plan and evaluation method is the device by which <em>Charles</em> assures  the state's interest. However, the court recognized that too much authority  given to the school could infringe on parental rights. It says this directly: <q>…we caution the superintendent or the school committee that the approval  of a homeschool proposal must not be conditioned on requirements that are not  essential to the State interest…</q> No superintendent or school committee  has the authority to give or deny a family permission to homeschool. The only  authority they retain is that of approving or disapproving the plan, and the  only agenda inherent in that authority is to ensure the child is being educated.</p>
           <p>Still, we are left  with the somewhat contradictory message of the statute's absolute requirement  of prior approval, and the statement in <em>Charles</em> that <q>…if  the parents commence the education of their children at home in the face of the  school committee's refusal to approve the parents' homeschool proposal, the  burden of proof… shifts to the school committee to show that the instruction  outlined in the homeschool proposal fails…</q> This is the most direct  reference in <em>Charles</em> to what should happen if a family  commences homeschooling without approval, and it directly states that in such a  case, the burden of proof shifts to the school. It has been argued that the  burden shifting protects the parents' interest by creating <q>a presumption  of adequacy of parental proposals for homeschooling.</q> Only a handful of  families complying with <em>Charles</em> have ever reached the  courtroom level in a dispute with the schools. In each of these few cases, the  family has won. It is important to remember that once a family has submitted a  plan that satisfies the guidelines outlined in <em>Charles,</em> that  family is making a good faith effort to comply with the law, and that counts.  In every Massachusetts homeschooling dispute that has made it to court that we  know of dating from the late 1970s (<em>Perchemlides,</em> <em>Charles,</em> <em>Searles,</em> <em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a>,</em> <em><a href="ivan.html">Ivan</a></em>) the child/ren have never  been ordered to attend school during the court proceedings.</p>
           <p>Families who choose  to homeschool, whether it involves not enrolling a child in school in the first  place, or withdrawing a child from one, need to decide for themselves whether  to commence homeschooling once the plan is submitted, taking into consideration  what is best for their child. Important factors to remember are that while the  school has no authority to deny the right to homeschool, they do have authority  to take legal action. However, no child has ever been ordered back to school  during the approval process, and no school has ever assumed the burden of proof  presented in <em>Charles</em> and won. In fact, the number of times it  has been attempted is miniscule. In reality, expediting approval has been the  norm. Also, based on longtime feedback from Massachusetts homeschoolers, and  judging from AHEM's research,  the vast majority of homeschoolers never have a dispute with the school.</p>
           <p>If a superintendent  and/or school committee disapproves a plan, the school has a few options. In  the vast majority of cases, when a school takes issue with an aspect of the  education plan, they will contact the family and offer the family the  opportunity to explain or remedy the plan, the avenue of response outlined  in <em>Charles.</em> In most such cases, legal intervention is not  necessary. Homeschoolers finding themselves in a situation like this can stand  their ground and still work successfully with the school system without the aid  of a lawyer (see <a href="best-advocate.html">Be Your Own Best Advocate</a>).</p>
           <h2>WRITTEN APPROVAL</h2>
               <p>While many school  districts supply homeschoolers with written letters of approval, not all do so.  Whether to request written approval is a personal choice. Some parents may feel  more comfortable with an approval letter and choose to contact the school to  ask for one. There is nothing in the law that requires parents to do so. Once  the parents have submitted what <em>Charles</em> requires, they have  fulfilled their responsibility. If the school disapproves the plan, they must  contact the family, not the other way around. It is also true that in practice,  many school districts choose not to supply approval letters. One thing parents  can do to have documentation that their plan has been received is to request a  receipt upon delivery of their home education plans, whether through the mail  or in person.</p>
               <h2>EVALUATION AND  APPROVAL</h2>
               <p>Depending on the  details of the education plan, the family may need to submit a form of  evaluation. Evaluation methods are agreed upon during approval, and are part of  the approval process. In rare cases, the school may take issue with the family  upon receipt of the agreed-upon form of evaluation. If the school deems that  the child is not receiving instruction that it is equal to what they would  provide, the school may consider that as a factor in approving or disapproving  future plans. In such cases, the school may choose to work with the family to  remedy the situation (the preferred option). If the family believes they have  satisfied the requirement that the instruction they are providing is equal to  the school's, it is the school's burden to prove that it does not. If the  school calls the approval of the plan into question, the school has the right  to initiate legal proceedings. But as with prior approval, the school will  assume the burden of proof. In practice, this just hasn't happened.</p>
               <h2>MID-YEAR CHANGES</h2>
               <p>We all know that one  of the great benefits of homeschooling is flexibility. Many homeschoolers  submit plans that incorporate flexibility, and those plans are approved. In  those cases, the school has pre-approved the option to be flexible with  content, and no such change in plans would be subject to prior approval.</p>
               <h2>TESTING</h2>
               <p>While the <em>Charles</em> decision  does state that <q>…the superintendent or school committee may properly  require periodic standardized testing…,</q> it goes on to say that  <q>Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted  for the formal testing process…</q> The court's main point was that  evaluation itself is not unconstitutional and may be required as part of the  approval process. It referenced testing specifically (that was the method the  family in <em>Charles</em> was using), but it made a point of allowing  other forms of evaluation, stressing that the method should be agreed upon by  the school and the family. The court did not make an unequivocal statement  about testing. If a dispute about testing arose between a family and school  system, and compromise could not be reached, the school would have to take the  family to court and prove that testing was essential to ensuring the state's  interest. It is our view that until such a case goes to court (if it ever  does), the question of whether testing can be required as a condition of  approval cannot be answered definitively.</p>
               <p>Clearly, the state  cannot dictate the manner in which we homeschool. When various methods of  education are at work, it follows that one method of evaluation for all may not  be the best approach. Under <em>Charles,</em> parents may work with the  schools to determine the method of evaluation that best fits the manner of  their homeschooling. And in practice, it does work this way in Massachusetts.  Most districts do not require testing, and readily accept alternative means of  evaluation.</p>
           <h2>THE FUTURE</h2>
           <p>While AHEM will  continue our work on behalf of Massachusetts homeschoolers, ultimately the most  significant and lasting protection for homeschooling rights will come from an  informed, educated homeschooling population. Therefore, we urge you to read the <a href="ma_hs_law.html">court decisions</a> pertinent to homeschooling in Massachusetts. In the process,  remember that the collective experience of Massachusetts homeschoolers, as well  as AHEM's research, show that the vast majority do not have problems  homeschooling in our state.</p>
