		   <h1>What Do You Think of When You Hear the Word "Portfolio"?</h1>
	   	   <p>The American  Heritage Dictionary defines a portfolio as:</p>
           <ul class="nested">
                  <li>	&ldquo;A portable case for holding material, such as loose papers, photographs, or drawings.</li>
                  <li>The materials collected in such a case, especially when representative of a person's work: a photographer's portfolio; an artist's portfolio of drawings.&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
           <p>A portfolio implies  a comprehensive package of materials, like the <q>case</q> described in  the above definition.</p>
                <p>Sometimes,  homeschoolers use the word <q>portfolio</q> to refer to the method of  evaluation they use. The fact is, the word <q>portfolio</q> does not  appear in Massachusetts homeschooling law. <a href="charles.html"><em>Charles</em></a> says that  school officials and parents should agree on one method of evaluation and  states the following as choices: testing, periodic progress reports, or dated  work samples. (<em>Charles</em> at 340)</p>
                <p>No portfolio  required.</p>
                <p>You may ask, isn't a  portfolio just a bunch of dated work samples? It could be — or it could be more  dated work samples than a homeschooler needs to provide, along with written  text that might qualify as a progress report. It could even include test  results. With the help of computers, the Internet, and other tools, some  homeschooling parents are fashioning digital portfolios for submission to  school districts. A portfolio may well contain more than Massachusetts  homeschooling law requires parents to submit to schools for the purpose of  evaluation.</p>
           <p>Let's look at the  reasons people may submit more than is required, then examine whether it  matters.</p>
                <ol class="nestedordered">
                  <li><h4>New homeschooler jitters</h4> <p>Families who've recently started homeschooling may feel nervous about whether they will receive approval. Sometimes, these nerves lead people to submit more. <a href="networking.html">Talking to other homeschoolers</a> and <a href="law_made_easy.html">reading up on the law</a> can help provide a sense of security.</p></li>
                  <li><h4>My kid is awesome! </h4>
                    <p>Parents may rightfully be excited about all the cool things their kids are doing. Keeping records and compiling portfolios can be both personally rewarding and important for some purposes like preparing for college or other applications, or sharing accomplishments with family members and friends&mdash;but not for reporting to your school district.</p></li>
                  <li><h4>Confusion</h4>
                    <p>Some homeschoolers may not be sure what the law requires, and may think that a portfolio is what's necessary. <a href="methods_eval.html">Familiarizing ourselves with the law</a> helps clarify our responsibilities.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Why does it matter  if some families submit portfolios? Shouldn't people do what feels comfortable?</h3>
                <p>When people over  report, it can affect other homeschoolers by raising the expectations of school  officials for all families in town. AHEM has received reports of cases in which  one family in town submitted extensive portfolios for their kids, and the  district then pressured other homeschoolers in town to submit similar information  for evaluation. While some families may feel fine about handing in a large  portfolio, other families may have reasons for not doing so, such as  philosophical opposition to testing, or a homeschooling style that focuses on  process more than product. Consider that submitting more than necessary also  sets up heightened expectations in future years for yourself, when  circumstances may have changed and you may not have as much time as now.</p>
                <p>Over reporting can  also have consequences over the longer term. Here's an example: <em>Charles</em> does  not specifically state the required frequency for submission of education  plans. Annual submission has become the norm. Some homeschoolers may even think  submitting an education plan once a year is required by law. It's not. But in a  legal challenge, common practice would make a difference. If submission of  portfolios became the norm in Massachusetts, eventually it could make a legal  difference.</p>
           <h3>What can homeschoolers  do?</h3>
                <ol class="nestedordered">
                  <li>
                    <h4><a href="ma-hs-law.html">Read the law</a></h4>
                  <p>Do it as many times as you need to in order to understand it. Understanding the law makes us more able to advocate for ourselves and for       homeschooling.</p></li>
                  <li><h4>Don't over report</h4>
                    <p>Choose the one form of evaluation that works for your family. If you pick progress report or dated work samples, carefully consider how much information is required to show your child's progress.</p></li>
                  <li><h4>Use clear language</h4>
                    <p>When discussing evaluation, avoid language that is not present in the law (portfolio), and use language that comes directly from the law (testing, periodic progress report, or dated work samples).</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Understanding the  law and making sure your education plan and evaluation do not exceed it are  important ways you can help protect homeschooling freedoms for everyone in  Massachusetts.</p>
