	<h1>Can Testing Be Required?</h1>
	<p>In Massachusetts,  homeschoolers are fortunate to have flexibility when it comes to the form of  evaluations we submit to our local districts.</p>
    <p>While testing is  preferred by some, many don&rsquo;t want to use testing, and according to AHEM&rsquo;s research, it&rsquo;s not  the most common form of evaluation used in Massachusetts.</p>
    <p>Occasionally a  school district will try to require homeschoolers to be tested, or circulate  (but not enforce) a policy that says testing is required. In cases such as  this, homeschoolers want to know, can testing be required?</p>
    <p>The question of  whether school officials can require testing of homeschoolers is not answered  definitively in Massachusetts law.</p>
    <p><em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> does state that “…the superintendent or  school committee may properly require periodic standardized testing of the  children to ensure educational progress and the attainment of minimum  standards.” (<em>Charles</em> at 339, 340). However, the decision goes on to  say, “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted  for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated work  samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340).</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to  remember that testing was the chosen method of evaluation for the family  involved in the <em>Charles</em> case. It&rsquo;s likely that when the court  stated that standardized testing may be required, it was addressing (and  answering <q>yes</q> to) the larger question of whether evaluation in general could  be required.</p>
    <p>The fact that the  court offers examples of other acceptable forms of evaluation, and stresses  that they should be <q>subject to the approval of the parents,</q> indicates that  the intent was not to allow schools the authority to dictate what type of  evaluation families use. Rather, the intent is to allow parents to retain a  choice in how their children are evaluated.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that  at this point a challenge on the requirement of standardized testing for  homeschoolers would make it to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. If it  did, what might happen?</p>
    <p><em>Charles</em> cautions superintendents and school  committees that <q>…the approval of a home school proposal must not be  conditioned on requirements that are not essential to the State interest…</q> in  ensuring that all children are educated. (<em>Charles</em>at 337). Since a  majority of districts in Massachusetts have long conducted homeschool oversight  without testing, meeting the standard of <q>essential</q> in a court of law would be  very difficult.</p>
    <p>Given the fact that  testing would likely not meet the standard of <q>essential,</q> and that requiring  homeschoolers to be tested does not seem to be in line with the intent of <em>Charles,</em> homeschoolers  who wish to stand their ground and say <q>no, thank you</q> to standardized testing  are in a good position.</p>
    <p class="footnote">This legal summary  was not drafted by practicing lawyers and is not intended to constitute  official legal advice, but rather is presented by AHEM volunteers and is based  on their reading and understanding of Massachusetts homeschooling requirements  as they have followed those requirements throughout the years. Readers still  need to make their own decision on how best to proceed.</p>
