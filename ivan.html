               <p>This court concluded  that parents' refusal to provide a school committee with the essentials of  their home schooling educational plan and failure to allow for any evaluation  of their children's educational attainments was a violation of the mandate  of <em>Care and Protection of Charles,</em> 399 Mass. 324, 337-340  (1987), and that a District Court judge correctly concluded that the children  were in need of care and protection and appropriately committed them  temporarily to the legal custody of the Department of Social Services. [89-91]</p>
               <p>PETITION filed in  the Waltham Division of the District Court Department on June 2, 1997.</p>
			 <p>The case was heard by <em>Margaret S. Fearey,</em> J.</p>
               <p>The parents, pro se.</p>
               <p><em>Kristyn M. Snyer</em>&nbsp;for the children.</p>

               <p><em>Susan Mojica,</em> pro se, amicus curiae, submitted a  brief.</p>
               <p>GREENBERG, J. The  parents of two minor children protest that the city of Waltham school  committee's (committee) demand that they provide information concerning the  home schooling of their children deprives them of protection under art. 12 of  the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We conclude that the parents' refusal  to provide the committee with the bare esssentials of their educational plan  and to allow for any evaluation of their children's educational attainments  transgresses the mandate of <em>Care and Protection of Charles,</em>399  Mass. 324,</p>
               
                 <hr class="hrfootnote">
               
               <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> A younger  sister, Olympia: we use pseudonyms, as is our custom.</p>
               <h4>88</h4>
               <p>337 340 (1987), and  affirm the decision of a District Court judge that the children are in need of  care and protection and committing them temporarily to the Department of Social  Services (department).</p>
               <p>This, in outline, is  the setting of the dispute. On June 2, 1997, on allegations that two children,  who were eight and ten years of age, were neither enrolled in a school nor had  approved home schooling plans on file with the committee, the committee  initiated this care and protection petition pursuant to G. L. c. 119, ยง 24<em>(d)</em>.<sup>2</sup> A  trial was held on January 21, 1998, with additional testimony taken on two  separate occasions through July 10, 1998. It is not necessary to chronicle in  detail the history of missed goals and failed performance of the parents once  the committee intervened in the case. It is only necessary to state that by the  end of almost two years of cajoling the parents to show that the children&rsquo;s  educational needs were being met, the judge found that the committee <q>has  been effectively prevented from evaluating whether or not educational neglect  exists, much less proving its existence, by the [p]arents&rsquo; failure to provide  any information regarding the [c]hildren&rsquo;s educational level, their mastery of  basic skills or the methods being used to educate them.</q></p>
               <p>Noting the recalcitrance  of the parents to produce <q>a minimally adequate educational plan</q> or  to permit any sort of verification of the children's educational progress,  despite numerous good faith efforts by the committee to accommodate them, the  judge, on July 29, 1998, ordered the parents to file educational plans, obtain  an independent professional evaluation of each child's educational level,  verify whether the children had acquired age appropriate knowledge and skills,  and to file such plans and evaluations by September 8, 1998. If the parents  neither fully complied nor enrolled the children in the Waltham public schools  or a private school approved by the committee, temporary legal custody of the  children would be transferred to the department.</p>
               <p>The parents did not  comply, and the judge, on October 7, 1998, adjudicated the children in need of  care and protection</p>
               
                 <hr class="hrfootnote">
               
               <p class="footnote"><sup>2</sup> The committee relies solely upon ยง  24(d) of the statute; specifically, that a petition shall issue if <q>any  person</q> alleges that a child within the jurisdiction of the court and  under the age of eighteen <q>[has] parents, guardian or custodian. . .  unwilling, incompetent or unavailable to provide [physical or educational]  care, discipline or attention.</q></p>
               <h4>89</h4>
               <p>and ordered  temporary legal custody transferred to the department. The children remain in  the physical custody of the parents. It is that adjudication order, based upon  the July 29, 1998, decision, that forms the basis of this appeal.</p>
               <p>The parents&rsquo;  principal contention is that the committee&rsquo;s process of approval of their home  schooling activity runs counter to their <q>learner led</q> approach to  education, which they claim permits them to facilitate the child&rsquo;s exploration  of his or her own interests. As the judge indicates in her findings on this  point, <q>This educational philosophy militates against the development of a  concrete <q>curriculum.</q></q> At the same time, the judge found that the  committee had no objection to the <q>[p]arents using this method of  education,</q> only that they had to provide the school committee with a home  schooling plan that was sufficiently detailed to allow the committee to assess  the children's educational level and their progress on the parents' home  schooling program. It is settled that <q>the approval process, under G. L.  c. 76. ยง 1, . . . must not be conditioned on requirements that are not  essential to the State interest in insuring that <q>all the children shall be  educated.</q></q><em>Care and Protection of Charles,</em> 399 Mass. at  337. However, prior approval of the superintendent or committee is a  prerequisite to removal of children from school and to the commencement of a  home schooling program. <em>Commonwealth v. Renfrew,</em> 332 Mass.  492, 494 (1950) (interpreting a predecessor statute). <em>Care and  Protection of Charles,</em>&nbsp;<em>supra</em> at 330.</p>
               <p>In the <em>Charles</em> case, <em>supra</em> at  337 340, the court listed some of the legitimate educational conditions which a  school committee, pursuant to G. L. c. 76, ยง 1, may impose on a home school  proposal <q>without infringing on the liberty interests of the parents under  the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution].</q> Pertinent  to this case are two: (1) for the parents to make available any proposed  education plan for the child and 
                 (2) to permit any testing or evaluation of the child. Contrast <em>Brunelle  v. Lynn Pub. Schools,</em> 428 Mass. 512, 518 519 (1998) (requirement of  home visits is not essential to home schooling). The parents' brief argues that  the <q>right [of parents] to direct the education . . . of their own  children</q> is protected by art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of  Rights and pt. 2, c. 5, ยง 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution and that their  <q>unalienable rights in privacy and the rearing of their children</q> may  not be infringed.</p>
               <h4>90</h4>
               <p>The only suggestion  in the record before us of the parents' specific objections to the committee's  stance is that contained in the judge's findings which state: <q>The school  committee also requires that parents submit progress reports, which may include  portfolios or work samples, either quarterly or semi annually . . . . [H]ome  schoolers must participate in certain standardized testing during grades 3, 4,  8 and 10.</q> There was no testimony or other evidence suggesting the nature  or extent of these tests. In any event, the judge found that <q>[t]he  parents . . . not only refuse even to submit the [c]hildren to standardized  testing; they also refuse to provide a portfolio of the [c]hildren's work for  review by the [s]chool [c]ommittee, viewing that work as the [c]hildren's  private property.</q></p>
               <p>When parents remove  their children from the public school system and decide to educate them in a  setting which comports with the parents' philosophical, moral, or religious  convictions, prior approval of such plans may clash with parental choice. In  that respect, decisions of the United States Supreme Court have recognized a  degree of autonomy afforded to parents with respect to the education of their  children. See <em>Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> 262 U.S. 390 (1923) (States  may not forbid foreign language instruction of school children); <em>Pierce  v. Society of Sisters,</em> 268 U.S. 510 (1925) (States may not prohibit  private school instruction as an alternative to compulsory education in public  schools); <em>Farrington v. Tokushige,</em> 273 U.S. 284 (1927)  (government could not pervasively regulate foreign language schools in which  students received instruction in the Japanese language as supplement to  English).</p>
               <p>In enacting G. L. c.  76, the Legislature was cognizant of these decisions which addressed parental  autonomy in other contexts. The statute, therefore, authorizes school  committees to use somewhat elastic standards in evaluating private schools. As  appears in the last sentence of the first paragraph of ยง 1: <q>[S]chool  committees shall approve a private school when satisfied that the instruction  in all the studies required by law equals in thoroughness and efficiency, and  in the progress made therein, [as] in the public schools in the same  town.</q> The <em>Charles</em> case extended the same criteria to  evaluate home education programs. <em>Care and Protection of Charles,</em> 399  Mass. at 331. The <em>Charles</em> court also suggested that school  authorities may jettison standardized testing for less orthodox means of  evaluating the progress of the children, โsuch as periodic</p>
               <h4>91</h4>
               <p>progress reports or  dated work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.&rdquo;<em>Id.</em> at  340. In the present case, it was always open to the parents to work out an  accommodation of their interests along the lines suggested by school  authorities and to resolve the matter by agreement. However, the judge found  that the parents never filed educational plans that were minimally adequate  within the guidelines set forth in <em>Charles.</em><sup>3</sup> The  record suggests that the parents were unwilling to permit any verification of the  children's educational progress by the committee.</p>
               <p>Perhaps more to the  point, the adjudication which had been entered in this case was a grant of  temporary legal custody to the department, but only after the judge extended  the parents a final opportunity to comply with her order to file an educational  plan with the committee and obtain an independent evaluation of the children's  knowledge and skills. Unlike the circumstances in the <em>Charles</em> case,  the parents in this case have had the benefit of a decision by the judge which  sets forth a reasonable course of action which would not jeopardize the  learning capacity of their children and recognizes their right to school their  children in their home.</p>
               <p>We think, therefore,  that the judge properly relied on G. L. c. 76, ยง 1, in determining that the  children would be, under G. L. c. 119, ยงยง 24 and 26, in need of care and  protection if their parents failed to comply with the judge's mandates with  respect to their educational care. The order of adjudication of commitment to  temporary custody is affirmed.</p>
