      <h1>House Bill 1220</h1>
        <h2>April 2006 update</h2>
      Â This bill has become part of a study order, HB 4822, and is now with a study committee in the House. In the study committee, the bill will undergo further review. If the bill doesn't move from that committee by December 31, 2006, it will be considered &quot;dead.&quot;</p>
      <p>
      <h2>May 2005</h2>
      On May 5th, 2005 a public hearing to afford citizens, legislators and lobbyists the opportunity to express their views, was held on House Bill 1220, which would allow homeschoolers to take the MCAS at state expense, and require schools to award diplomas to homeschoolers who pass MCAS and request a diploma.</p>
<p>The researcher for the Education committee told AHEM a woman and her daughter were the only two people to testify at the public hearing. The bill was also mentioned by a few other people as they spoke in support or opposition to other bills that day. Researchers are now going through the written testimony that has been submitted and sorting that out to be included in the official record.</p>
      <p>There is no executive session scheduled yet for this bill. The executive session is for the committee to review the public testimony and discuss the merits of the bill before making their recommendations to the full membership of the House. The committee then issues its report, recommending that a bill âought to passâ or âought not to passâ and the report is submitted to the Clerk's office. An âexecutiveâ session in the legislature is not private. The public may observe, but not participate in, these meetings. (Information on how the legislative process in Massachusetts work is taken fromÂ   <a href="http://www.malegislature.gov/Engage/HowIdeaBecomesLaw">http://www.malegislature.gov/Engage/HowIdeaBecomesLaw</a>.)</p>
      <p>If you didnât express an opinion on this bill but now wish you had, it is not to late to email or call your own representatives and the chairs of the Education committee. See below.</p>
      <p>
      <h2>Thoughts on HB 1220 </h2>
        HB 1220, a bill filed by Rep. Paul Loscocco (Republican - Eighth Middlesex), has been assigned to the Education committee. The bill would amend Section 1I of chapter 69 of the general laws. The bill refers to students who are &quot;otherwise instructed.&quot; Since homeschoolers in Massachusetts fall under the category of &quot;otherwise instructed&quot; in the Massachusetts general laws, this bill would affect homeschoolers. While the text of the bill refers to private and parochial students as well as to otherwise instructed students, the description of the bill in the House Docket says, &quot;Home schooling.&quot;</p>
      <p>The bill (text below) would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>require schools to allow homeschoolers and private school students residing in their district to take the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>require the state to pay for the administration of the test;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>require schools to award diplomas to homeschoolers who pass MCAS and request a diploma;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>allow schools to offer &quot;remedial&quot; help for homeschoolers who &quot;failâ¦ to meet the requirements of the competency determination;</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above is what we know about the bill. In reading it, we find some grey areas to consider:</p>
      <p>        This bill could create administrative confusion for homeschoolers and school officials.        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Is this bill asking for special treatment of homeschoolers</strong>Â by requiring schools to issue diplomas based solely on passing MCAS, thereby rendering local graduation requirements meaningless? Or would superintendents feel the need to fulfill their mandate to assure that every student receiving a high school diploma in their district fulfills local graduation requirements, which include coursework as well as a passing grade on the MCAS, and so make excessive demands on homeschoolers?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>How might the requirement that schools issue diplomas to homeschoolers who pass the MCAS affect the expectations schools have for all homeschoolers</strong>Â in their district, any of whom may decide to opt for the exam at some future date? Would approval of plans become tied to how closely they are aligned to the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks? Would superintendents feel obligated to disapprove of future homeschool plans for homeschooled students who have failed MCAS?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>How might superintendents respond to homeschoolers who fail the exam,</strong>given that the current text of the bill appears to allow the school to decide whether to provide a remedial plan to a homeschooled student who fails MCAS? Although the bill allows private and parochial students to take MCAS, those students are not included in the section that addresses remedial plans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>And:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> According to the Massachusetts Department of Education,Â <strong>&quot;â¦the MCAS tests, â¦ are designed to measure the academic progress of students enrolled in publicly supported schools and the performance of those schools.&quot;</strong>Â The MCAS is intended to reflect how well actual schools are performing in implementing the frameworks outlined in the Education Reform Act of 1993, as well as to assess whether individual students are being educated sufficiently through the application of the frameworks. Might using a test that was created for these very specific purposes as nothing more than a hoop to jump through to be issued a diploma from a school the student did not actually attend feel to school officials like mocking the test and the system it is designed to evaluate? Might it create antagonism between homeschoolers and schools?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>The federalÂ <em>No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB),</em>Â requires public school students to fulfill a range of requirements for their school to be eligible for federal funding.</strong>Â These include the statewide MCAS exam; providing the same academic standards for all schools and children in the State; and &quot;adequate yearly progress,&quot; of which measurements include graduation rates for high schools and attendance rates for elementary and middle schools. Would it be a violation of NCLB to issue a diploma to students who may not have met all the federal requirements? Whether it actually is or not, will superintendents be confused and concerned about this in practice, and make homeschoolers' lives more difficult because of that confusion?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Whenever a bill is introduced, the possibility exists that it will be modified as it passes through the legislative process.</strong>Â In the current climate of high stakes testing and greater accountability, is it in homeschoolers' best interests to push for a bill that would require spending state and local time and money on homeschoolers, with no benefit to the public school system? Does this bill create an opportunity and justification for our legislature to demand greater regulation of homeschooling in Massachusetts?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Also consider:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>High school diplomas are not necessary for homeschoolers to pursue college or other goals</strong>Â in the majority of cases. For most of homeschooling history in Massachusetts, homeschoolers have gone on to pursue goals after homeschooling, including matriculating at selective universities, without diplomas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Most colleges are familiar with homeschooled applicants,</strong>Â and are primarily interested in their portfolios, the meat of the application, considering a high school diploma or GED a bureaucratic box to check off in some cases. It is wise to check with places of interest, such as candidate colleges, workplaces, or the military to find out what their acceptance and matriculation requirements are.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>High school diplomas are not necessary for federal financial aid.</strong> See <a href="FAFSA.html">Homeschoolers and Federal Student Aid</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>In cases where diplomas are required, alternatives to public high school diplomas are currently available to homeschoolers.</strong>Â The General Education Development Diploma (GED) already exists as a widely accepted credential, as well as other alternatives to public high school diplomas, such as parent issued diplomas, or enrollment in an umbrella school or a correspondence school that offers a diploma program.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          The GED is an appropriate test for students such as homeschoolers, who have embraced an alternative education style, to measure their knowledge and academic skills against those of today's traditional high school graduates. The GED Tests measure knowledge in five different areas: language arts, writing; social studies; science; reading; and mathematics. Statistics: About two-fifths of graduating high school seniors don't pass the tests under current score requirements. About one in twenty first-year college students is a GED graduate. (<a href="http://www.acenet.edu/clll/ged/index.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.acenet.edu/clll/ged/index.cfm</a>)          </li>

        <h2>How to respond</h2>
        <h6>AHEM's position</h6>
      Â As parents who have chosen to &quot;otherwise educate&quot; our children, we feel this bill is unnecessary, and could possibly create problems for homeschoolers in exchange for dubious benefit.</p>
<p>AHEM representatives have been in contact with Rep. Loscocco and his staff to voice our concerns about the bill. We also hand delivered letters to members of the Education committee, detailing our concerns. The public hearing is scheduled forThursday, May 5 at 1:00 pm in Room B-2 of the State House.Â Homeschoolers who would like to voice their opinion about the bill are welcome to attend this hearing.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to voice your opinion about this bill, the most effective thing you can do is to let your own state senator and representative know your position. (Find their names and contact info here:<a href="http://www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.php" target="_blank">www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.php</a>)</p>
      <p>Best is a letter in your own words, butÂ even just a phone call or email stating your position, no reason given, is better than saying nothing at all.Â If you write a letter, it can also help to copy your letter to the Chairs of the Joint committee on Education, Senator Robert Antonioni and Representative Patricia Haddad.</p>
      <p>If your senator or representative happens to be a member of the Joint committee on Education, then we urge you to take the extra time to write him or her a letter in your own words, as your opinion will carry more weight than the average Joe's.</p>
      <p>If you would send AHEM a copy of your letter, or just let us know that you've made your voice heard, we'd be most grateful. Please drop us a line atÂ <a href="mailto:infor@ahem.info">info@ahem.info</a>Â or PO Box 1307, Arlington, MA 02474.</p>
      <p>
        <h6>Points to consider when formulating your thoughts </h6>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> HB 1220 places an administrative and fiscal burden on the public schools.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The MCAS is intended to reflect how well actual schools are performing in implementing the frameworks outlined in the Education Reform Act of 1993, as well as to assess whether individual students are being educated sufficiently through the application of the frameworks. The MCAS were developed for a specific purpose, one that is beyond the scope of homeschooling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Oversight of home education is a local function in Massachusetts, enabling school authorities to exercise discretion and flexibility in evaluating home education plans and student progress. This bill interferes with local oversight by requiring schools to issue diplomas to homeschoolers who pass the MCAS and request a diploma. We are concerned that this requirement could create administrative confusion for homeschoolers and school officials.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are the requirements of the bill in sync with the federalÂ <em>No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB),</em>Â which requires public school students to fulfill a range of requirements for their school to be eligible for federal funding?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When we chose to homeschool, we did it with eyes open, making the decision to forego public high school diplomas in favor of the freedom that homeschooling allows us and our children.</p>
        </li>
        <li>          Most colleges are familiar with homeschooled applicants, who have chosen an alternative form of education. Diplomas are not necessary for college admission or to qualify for federal financial aid.</li>
      </ul>

SECTION 1: Section 1I of chapter 69 of the general laws, as appearing in the 2000 official edition, is hereby amended by inserting after the sixth paragraph the following two paragraphs:</p>
<p>The superintendent of every public school district in the commonwealth shall on or before October 15 each year notify in writing the headmaster of each private and parochial school and the parent or guardian of every student who is otherwise instructed within the district of the opportunity for said private or parochial school or otherwise instructed student voluntarily to participate in and with the statewide assessment of students in grades 4, 8, and 10 as authorized in section 1I of chapter 69; provided, however, that the results of any such assessment tests by private and parochial school students or of any student who is otherwise instructed shall not be used to evaluate the performance of any public school within the school district or the performance of the school district and all records of such results shall be collected and maintained separately by the department; provided further, however, that no public funds shall be expended by the public school district for any costs associated with the acquisition, distribution, or administration of said tests relative to any student of each such private and parochial school unless that student resides in the public school district where such private or parochial school is located. Any private or parochial school or the parents or guardians of any student attending any private or parochial school or of any student who is otherwise instructed electing to have any student participate in said testing shall notify the superintendent of the decision no later than November 15, with any such participation at all times to be voluntary.</p>
      <p>Any student who is otherwise instructed pursuant to this section and who requests a diploma from a public high school shall be required to satisfy the requirements of the competency determination established in section 1D of chapter 69 as a condition for receiving said diploma, which upon satisfaction of such requirements of competency determination shall be granted; provided, however, that the assessment instrument used to verify competency determination shall be given at state expense; and provided further that in the case of any student who is otherwise instructed and fails to meet the requirements of the competency determination, the school district may, but shall not be required to, provide a remedial plan as defined in subsection (i) of section 1D of chapter 69; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the rights of any student otherwise instructed who re-enrolls as a student within the public school district.

        <h2>AHEM's letter to the Education committeeÂ - March 24, 2005</h2>
      <strong>      </strong>Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, Inc. (AHEM) is a nonprofit, independent, grassroots, volunteer-run, educational organization that gathers and disseminates information about homeschooling in Massachusetts through education, advocacy, and events. We are writing to you regarding House Bill 1220, filed by Rep. Paul Loscocco (Republican - Eighth Middlesex), which has been referred to the Joint committee on Education.</p>
      <p>In Massachusetts homeschooling is governed by case law, in conjunction with applicable statutes. The most important case is Care and Protection of Charles &amp; others, 399 Mass. 324 (1987). In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the compulsory attendance statute, General Laws Chapter 76, Section 1: &quot;Every child between the minimum and maximum ages established for school attendance by the board of education, â¦ shall, subject to section fifteen, attend a public day school in said town, or some other day school approved by the school committee, â¦ but such attendance shall not be required of a child â¦ who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee.&quot; Homeschoolers are &quot;otherwise instructed.&quot; In its decision, the Court was aware of the need to balance two basic tenets - the constitutional right of the parents to homeschool and the state's interest in the education of its citizenry. The result was delegation of homeschooling oversight to local school districts. Each city or town has discretion in determining how to conduct oversight.</p>
      <p>HB 1220 would amend Section 1I of chapter 69 of the general laws. It would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>require schools to allow homeschoolers and private school students residing in their district to take the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) exam;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>require the state to pay for the administration of the test;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>require schools to award diplomas to homeschoolers who pass MCAS;</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have a variety of concerns about the bill:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>HB 1220 places an administrative and fiscal burden on the public schools to &quot;notify in writing the headmaster of each private and parochial school and the parent or guardian of every student who is otherwise instructed within the district of the opportunity for said private or parochial school or otherwise instructed student voluntarily to participate in and with the statewide assessment of students in grades 4, 8, and 10â¦&quot; There are also costs involved with the acquisition, distribution, and administration of the test, and the collection and maintenance of test results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>According to the Massachusetts Department of Education, &quot;â¦the MCAS tests, â¦ are designed to measure the academic progress of students enrolled in publicly supported schools and the performance of those schools.&quot; The MCAS is intended to reflect how well actual schools are performing in implementing the frameworks outlined in the Education Reform Act of 1993, as well as to assess whether individual students are being educated sufficiently through the application of these frameworks. Using a test that was created for these very specific purposes as a hoop to jump through to be issued a diploma from a school the student did not actually attend does not remotely relate to the intent and purpose of the test.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Oversight of home education is a local function in Massachusetts, enabling school authorities to exercise discretion and flexibility in evaluating home education plans and student progress. This bill interferes with local oversight by requiring schools to issue diplomas to homeschoolers who pass the MCAS. (Prior to the graduation requirement that students achieve a passing score on the 10th grade MCAS, the decision to issue diplomas to homeschoolers was left to the discretion of local school districts.) We are concerned that this requirement could create administrative confusion for homeschoolers and school officials. The possibility that homeschoolers might opt to take the MCAS and thereby become eligible for a public high school diploma might cause schools to feel pressure to make homeschoolers' curricula conform to that of the public schools, thereby impinging on our freedom to individualize educational methods and approaches for our children, one of the primary reasons we choose to homeschool, and a right that is guaranteed in Massachusetts case law governing homeschooling. (Charles at 339) Also, would requiring schools to issue diplomas based solely on passing MCAS render local graduation requirements meaningless?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are the requirements of the bill in sync with the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which requires public school students to fulfill a range of requirements for their school to be eligible for federal funding?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>While this bill does not directly address the issue of private and parochial school students' eligibility for the Adams Scholarships, it would remove the current obstacle of them not being allowed to take the MCAS. One way to address the scholarship eligibility issue that would avoid the confusing elements of this bill, would be to change the eligibility requirement for the Adams Scholarship from the MCAS to the SAT or other test or GPA that is not based on the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks, thereby leveling the playing field for all students in Massachusetts, public, private, or otherwise instructed. (See Georgia's HOPE Scholarship.)</p>
      <p>Most colleges are familiar with homeschooled applicants, who have chosen an alternative form of education. Diplomas are not necessary for college admission or to qualify for federal financial aid. In cases where diplomas are required, the General Education Development Diploma (GED) already exists as a widely accepted credential, as well as other alternatives to public high school diplomas, such as parent issued diplomas, or enrollment in an umbrella school or a correspondence school that offers a diploma program.      </p>
      <p>As parents who have chosen to &quot;otherwise educate&quot; our children, we feel this bill is unnecessary. When we chose to homeschool, we did it with eyes open, making the decision to forego public high school diplomas in favor of the freedom and flexibility that homeschooling allows us and our children. We are able to do what works best for our children because we do not have the restrictions of public school. We respect that the MCAS tests were developed for a specific purpose, one that is beyond the scope of homeschooling.</p>
