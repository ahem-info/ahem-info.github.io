			   <h1>Handling It Ourselves</h1>
		   <h4>By Shay Seaborne of Virginia; adapted for Massachusetts homeschoolers by Milva McDonald</h4>
		   		<p>New homeschoolers understandably worry about meeting local  requirements and interacting with superintendents. Even veterans may feel  intimidated by the presumed authority of the school officials with whom they  necessarily have contact. This apparently was the case with an experienced  homeschooling mom who called me in mid-July, wanting to know whether I had  already <q>asked permission</q> to homeschool this year. Shocked at hearing  that term from a seasoned homeschooler, I uttered the refrain I repeat on  discussion lists, via email, over the phone, and in person: <q>We are not  asking permission to homeschool; we are notifying the superintendent that we  are homeschooling.</q><sup>1</sup></p>
               	<p>The following day a mom on a statewide discussion list put her  finger on the crux of the problem when she wrote, <q>The school system did  its job on me. I'm afraid to question their authority!</q> This may be the  reason that many homeschooling parents&mdash;full-fledged adults&mdash;feel intimidated  in the face of school officials. Those old feelings return, the same ones that  arose when we received the threat of being sent to the principal's office.  Kafkaesque specters of interrogation and a sense of impending danger may also  haunt us. Being aware of this, we can choose to empower ourselves by knowing  the law, by providing only legally required materials and by learning from and  joining with other homeschooling parents. Through these measures we can face  our fears and respond confidently and appropriately when dealing with school  officials who may ask for more than the law requires.</p>
               	<p>When homeschoolers provide more information than required by law,  superintendents can become used to the additional materials, and start asking  for them from others, unwittingly creating the perceived need for <q>legal  protection.</q> It is a vicious cycle. As children we learned to fear school  officials' power, and when we homeschool, they present themselves as the  authority. School officials can be intimidating. We become afraid and give them  whatever they want, without examining whether the request is in alignment with  the law, hoping we'll be left alone. But doing so simply shows the officials  that we are compliant, and they ask for more because we've demonstrated that  we'll give them whatever they want. They continue to ask for more, we feel  threatened, and we think we are incapable of stopping the cycle without  intervention from an organization.</p>
               <p>But we homeschooling parents are our own best protection. It isn't  necessary to call in lawyers and conjure visions of lawsuits when a school  district requests more than the law requires. Most superintendents are  reasonable and are just trying to do their job to the best of their ability.  They may simply be unmotivated to learn the complexities and details of our  murky home education law, so why uncork the vinegar bottle before you have  tried using honey? With a little support and encouragement from each other,  homeschoolers can effectively respond to superintendents' offices that overstep  their bounds.</p>
           <p>For example, some superintendents ask for a meeting with the  parents, which is beyond what the law requires. Parents can respond with a  simple, cordial letter stating that they prefer to conduct the approval process  through mail correspondence. If necessary, the parents might also ask where in  the law it says such a visit is required. More often than not, and usually very  quickly, the school grants the family approval. Other requests Massachusetts  superintendents make that parents can gracefully decline to fulfill are a  detailed schedule of hours, home visits, use of standardized testing, and use  of a purchased curriculum.</p>
           <p>In cases where we submit the appropriate paperwork and the school denies approval, we can know that we have done what the law requires. If the school chooses to pursue a case against us, they must assume the burden of proof.</p>
           <p>When homeschoolers handle the small encounters ourselves we  prevent them from snowballing into more serious difficulties. Dealing directly  with our local school officials, we avoid falling into depending upon an  organization to take care of us. We can retain our individual power and  autonomy and demonstrate that homeschoolers are confident, polite, and  proactive, rather than fearful and aggressively reactive.</p>
               <p>Homeschoolers often contact AHEM with questions about local  homeschool policies. We cannot stress enough that policies are not law. Based  on our research on local homeschool policies, it is quite common for a written  homeschool policy to exceed the law. While seeking to change your local  homeschool policy for the better may be a noble effort, it is not necessary to  do it just to avoid following objectionable policy points. Anything in a policy  that exceeds the law may be ignored. In fact, <a href="hs_policies.html">homeschoolers in Massachusetts  regularly ignore bogus policy points and submit only what the law requires with  no negative consequences</a>.</p>
               <p>Through individual courage and commitment to providing only what  the law requires, we protect our homeschooling rights. It is in our best  interest to claim that responsibility on an individual level as much as we can,  and to encourage others to do the same.</p>
           <p>A new homeschooler, filing for her first time, confessed that she  is <q>not fearless, like you are.</q> But I am not fearless. Rather, I  vowed, after a bad experience years ago, to avoid taking action based on fear.  I am still afraid at times, but I face my fear, utilize the resources  available, and trust that everything will turn out all right. And it has.</p>

		   <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>In Massachusetts, we must receive approval prior to the  commencement of our homeschooling program. It is important, however, to  distinguish between asking permission, and the concept of approval as it exists  in Massachusetts law. <em><a href="charles.html">Care and Protection of Charles</a></em> does  not require parents to ask permission to homeschool. Rather, it acknowledges  the parental right to homeschool. The requirement to receive approval from  local school officials comes directly from the Massachusetts compulsory  attendance statute. The court in <em>Charles</em> upheld this statute,  and laid out guidelines for homeschooling regulation. The court attempted to  balance the acknowledged parental right to homeschool with the state interest  in the education of its citizenry as expressed in the Massachusetts  Constitution. Thus, they put limits on what the school could ask for, and  shifted the burden of proof to the school in cases where the school disapproves  the home education plan. The school's limited authority to ask for only what is  <q>essential</q> to assuring the state interest was not granted so the  school could determine whether to allow parents to homeschool or not. It was  granted to ensure that all children in the state receive instruction equal in  thoroughness and efficiency, and in the progress made therein, of that in the  public schools in the same town. When school officials evaluate homeschooling  plans, they are required to do it with an eye to that, and only that, and if  they deny approval they must prove that the instruction in all the studies is  not <q>equal in thoroughness and efficiency, and in the progress made  therein, of that in the public schools in the same town.</q> This process is  very different from asking permission.</p>
