			<li><h4 id="1">My child is in ... grade. What subjects do I need to teach?</h4>
<p>Whether you are just beginning with a first grader or are entering the dreaded high school years, you may be wondering what subjects you need to include in your <a href="sample_ed_plan.html">education plan </a>in order to get it approved.</p> 

		<p>Homeschoolers in Massachusetts actually have a lot of freedom. The law makes clear that your district cannot tell you how to educate (see <em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em> at 518). Nor are there any specific requirements for what is taught on a year-by-year basis. The Massachusetts General Laws&nbsp; Chapters <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter69/Section1D" target="_blank">69</a> and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter71" target="_blank">71</a> list a number of subjects that need to be covered at some point in your child’s education. However, you do not have to do every subject mentioned every year.</p>

		<p>On a practical level, if you do not mention English-language arts or mathematics in your education plan, your town may ask about them, but there are no specific subject requirements for a given year.</p>  <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>   
			   
<li><h4 id="2">I sent in my education plan and my town is asking for my ‘scope, goals and objectives’ for each subject. Is this something I need to give them?</h4></li>
<p>As with many questions about homeschool reporting in Massachusetts, there is not a simple yes or no answer to this one. Your district can ask about your curriculum and materials. Since you already sent in your education plan, you have probably given them at least a list of materials and subjects to be covered. The real question here is how much detail they can ask for.</p> 

<p><em>Care and Protection of Charles</em> says: <q>The superintendent or school committee must also have access to the textbooks, workbooks, and other instructional aids to be used by the children and to the lesson plans and teaching manuals to be used by the parents.</q> It makes clear, however, that this access is <q>only to determine subject and grade level.</q> (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> at 339)</p>

<p><em>Charles</em> and the other decisions that regulate homeschooling in the state are always seeking to balance the parents’ rights with the government’s responsibilities. Districts may ask for some degree of detail when it comes to curriculum and materials, enough  to be able to determine <q>subject and grade level.</q> As always, their requests must be <q><a href="news-archives/2022/20220922_essential.html">essential</a>.</q> A full scope and sequence with goals and objectives would seem to exceed this standard.</p>

<p>How then can you respond to such requests? It is helpful to think of ramping up slowly. Often towns will be satisfied with a little more detail, perhaps a few specific topics that will be covered for major subject areas. If you are uncomfortable providing more information or believe that you have provided all that is required, don't afraid to <a href="best-advocate.html">advocate for yourself</a>. Those approving homeschooling plans may genuinely not be familiar with the specifics of the law. Polite dialogue, quoting the relevant cases where applicable, can go a long way. As always, if you have further questions or need help working through particulars, <a href="one-on-one.html">AHEM is here to help</a>.</p> 

<li><h4 id="3">My town is asking for a detailed schedule. Is this something I need to give them?</h4></li>
<p>The <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> decision states that: <q>The superintendent or school committee may properly  consider the length of the proposed home school year and the hours of  instruction in each subject</q> (<em>Charles</em> at 339). <em><a href="brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em></a> acknowledges  that <q>While following a schedule may be an important consideration in a  public school where preexisting schedules need to be maintained and  coordinated, the perception and use of time in a home school are different. The  plaintiffs can observe and accommodate variations (from child to child, subject  to subject, day to day) in the learning process and teach through a process  that paces each student.</q> (<em>Brunelle</em> at 518). While specifically discussing the need for home visits (which it rules as non-essential), <em>Brunelle</em> goes on to imply that there is no need to ensure that a formal schedule is being  followed.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, what this means is that while districts may ask about  schedule, parents do not need to replicate what is happening in the public  schools but only to equal it in <q>thoroughness and efficiency.</q> The  personalized nature of homeschooling tends to make it more efficient, and  instructional time in a homeschool may include  such activities as independent study, field trips, and hands-on learning.</p>
<p>If asked about their homeschool year, many parents write that they will  provide the equivalent in <q>thoroughness and efficiency</q> of the 180 days, 900/990 hours of instruction required yearly in the public  schools. If school officials insist on more detail than this, some submit  an estimate of hours per subject per year, prefaced by a statement such as:  <q>Because of the flexible nature of homeschooling, the following is  necessarily an estimate of hours of instruction spent per subject.</q> If officials persist in requesting a detailed schedule, it might be useful to cite  the above quote from <em>Brunelle</em>regarding the flexibility of homeschooling. Districts are not  authorized to go so far as to ask for an hourly or daily schedule.</p>
