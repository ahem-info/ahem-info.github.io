		   <h1>AHEM Networking Forum</h1> 
		   <p>AHEM runs a moderated, email-based discussion forum for our <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">subscribers</a>. This is a place to ask questions and connect with other homeschoolers.</p>
		   <h4>Interested  in joining?</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li><a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">Subscribe to AHEM's low volume, announcement-only email list.</a></li>
           <li><a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Please send an invitation to join forum.">Email request</a> to join forum or join at the forum website&nbsp; <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/ahem_inc/about" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
		   <li>Look for an invitation from ahem_inc@googlegroups.com in the next couple of days. (Don't forget to check your spam folder!)</li>
		   <li><strong>Membership constitutes agreement with the guidelines. Please read on!</strong></li>
         </ul>
			 <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                  
           <h4>Members must abide by the Forum  Etiquette</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>No spam.</li>
           <li>No flaming or harassment of other members.</li>
           <li>Refrain from shouting (i.e. using capital  letters to make a point).</li>
           <li>Trim posts.</li>
           <li>Make sure subject line is pertinent.</li>
           <li>Sign your messages.</li>
           <li>Do not forward messages without permission.</li>
           <li>Respect the privacy policy.</li>
           <li>Respect the advertising policy.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><em>Reminder:</em> Replies are sent by default to the whole group  rather than to the sender alone. Also, your email will be visible to other  members of the group.</p>     
		   
		    <h4>Organizing Events, Sharing Interests and Expertise</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>Events are organized by individuals, and are not  &ldquo;official group events.&rdquo;</li>
          
           <li>Individuals should use due diligence when money  changes hands: use checks, money orders, PayPal, Venmo or other means for  payment rather than cash, get confirmation in writing, etc.</li>
         </ul>
		   <h4>Advertising Policy</h4>
         <p>No advertising or soliciting is allowed in order to focus  the list on families connecting, rather than being marketed to. In practice this  means: </p>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>You <em>cannot</em> promote any service, institution, organization,  or curriculum for the sole purpose of advertising/promotion. This includes soliciting  members for coops or learning centers. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> ask for recommendations for classes, tutors, and resources and you <em>can</em> respond to such requests with  recommendations that you have had personal experience with. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> recruit others to join you in a class or activity you are organizing or signed  up for where you need to have a minimum number of participants for the program  to run. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> offer to share a skill or area of expertise if someone is looking for a  knowledgeable person.</li>
           <li>Not sure? <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">Ask!</a></li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Privacy  Policy</h4>
         <p>The group archives, posts, and members’ contact information  are intended for personal reference only. Nothing shall be reprinted in any  other publication or forwarded online without express permission of the author.  The contact information of fellow homeschoolers is for personal use only.</p>
        
		   			 
         <h4>The Fine Print</h4>
         <p>You agree to not use  the List to:</p>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any&nbsp; content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious,  defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful,  or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;</li>
           <li>harm minors in any way;</li>
           <li>impersonate any person or entity;</li>
           <li>upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any content that you do not have a right to transmit;</li>
           <li>upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any  unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, <q>junk  mail,</q> <q>spam,</q> <q>chain letters,</q> <q>pyramid  schemes,</q> or any other form of solicitation;</li>
           <li>upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any  material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or  programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any  computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;</li>
           <li>disrupt the normal flow of dialogue or otherwise  act in a manner that negatively affects other users' ability to engage in real-time exchanges;</li>
           <li>intentionally or unintentionally violate any  applicable local, state, national or international law, or any regulations  having the force of law; </li>
           <li><q>stalk</q> or otherwise harass another. </li>
         </ul>
