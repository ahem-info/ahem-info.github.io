		   <h1>AHEM Networking Forum</h1> 
		   <h4>Interested  in joining?</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li><a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">Subscribe to AHEM list.</a></li>
           <li><a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Please send an invitation to join forum.">Email request to join forum.</a></li>
		   <li>Look for an invitation from ahem_inc@googlegroups.com in the next couple of days. (Don't forget to check your spam folder!)</li>
		   <li><strong>Membership constitutes agreement with the guidelines. Please read on!</strong></li>
         </ul>
			 <h2>Guidelines</h2>
         <p><em>Please read through  these guidelines before joining. Thanks!</em></p>
         <p>The purpose of this forum is to provide a common space for independent, family-based  homeschoolers to network, share resources, plan face-to-face events, classes, and  get-togethers.</p>
         <h4>You must be an adult <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">subscribed to the  AHEM list</a> to join this moderated networking fourm.</h4>
         <h4>If you need help with a specific home education plan, please call the <a href="one-on-one.html">AHEM  contact</a><a> rather than discussing on this list. </a></h4>
         <blockquote>In addition to protecting your  family’s privacy, we have found that focused one-on-one support leads to more  satisfying outcomes than wide ranging discussion in a public forum. <a href="one-on-one.html">You can find your AHEM  contact here.</a></blockquote>
         <h3>Membership  constitutes agreement with the following:</h3>
         <h4>You will post to a regional group based  on your town of residence. Please, no cross-posting between regions.</h4>
         <p>The intent is to increase the likelihood of connecting with homeschoolers in your local area.</p>
         <h4>The 12 regional groups are:</h4>
    
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>BERKSHIRES</li>
           <li>BOSTON METRO</li>
           <li>CAPE ANN</li>
           <li>CAPE COD AND THE ISLANDS</li>
           <li>CENTRAL MASS</li>
           <li>MERRIMACK VALLEY</li>
           <li>METROWEST NORTH </li>
           <li>METROWEST SOUTH</li>
           <li>NORTHERN BRISTOL COUNTY</li>
           <li>PIONEER VALLEY</li>
           <li>SOUTH COAST</li>
           <li>SOUTH SHORE</li>
		   </ul>
         <h4>Advertising Policy</h4>
         <p>No advertising or soliciting is allowed in order to focus  the list on families connecting, rather than being marketed to. In practice this  means: </p>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>You <em>cannot</em> promote any service, institution, organization,  or curriculum for the sole purpose of advertising/promotion. This includes soliciting  members for coops or learning centers. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> ask for recommendations for classes, tutors, and resources and you <em>can</em> respond to such requests with  recommendations that you have had personal experience with. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> recruit others to join you in a class or activity you are organizing or signed  up for where you need to have a minimum number of participants for the program  to run. </li>
           <li>You <em>can</em> offer to share a skill or area of expertise if someone is looking for a  knowledgeable person.</li>
           <li>Not sure? <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">Ask!</a></li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Privacy  Policy</h4>
         <p>The group archives, posts, and members&rsquo; contact information  are intended for personal reference only. Nothing shall be reprinted in any  other publication or forwarded online without express permission of the author.  The contact information of fellow homeschoolers is for personal use only</p>
         <h4>Organizing Events, Sharing Interests and Expertise</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>Events are organized by individuals, and are not  &ldquo;official group events.&rdquo;</li>
          
           <li>Individuals should use due diligence when money  changes hands: use checks, money orders, PayPal, Venmo or other means for  payment rather than cash, get confirmation in writing, etc.</li>
         </ul>
		   <h4>Calendar</h4>
		   <ul class="nested">
			   <li>There is one calendar for the forum.</li>
			   <li>Feel free to add get-togethers, events, and activities that you are attending to the group&rsquo;s  Google calendar and invite group members.</li>
			   <li>Please include your phone and/or email so you can be contacted if necessary. </li>
			   <li>Include at least a zip code for location.</li>
		   </ul>

         <h4>The Fine Print</h4>
