      <h1>Progress Report for an Eight-Year-Old and a Ten-Year-Old</h1>
      <p>        July 17, 2003</p>
      <p>Dr. Smith<br />
PO Box 123<br />
      Anytown, MA</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Smith,</p>
      <p>We are writing with Clyde's and Bonnie's end-year reports. We plan to continue homeschooling for the 2003-2004 year.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Mr. &amp; Ms. Jones</p>
      <p>        Clyde Jones [10 years old]</p>
      <p>Clyde continues to be a ravenous reader. He reads to himself for a couple of hours every day and we still read to him as well. He gets a lot of enjoyment as well as information from books and magazines. We frequent the library, and a partial list of books Clyde has read alone or with us is attached.</p>
      <p>Since January, he has been a member of the editorial board of a newspaper by and for kids. He writes articles for it, and makes decisions about content and layout. Clyde's spelling has improved as he writes more. He sat in on a meeting of a writers' group of kids ages eleven and up and is seriously considering joining them in the fall.</p>
      <p> Clyde and his father are working their way through Elementary Algebra by Harold Jacobs.</p>
      <p>Clyde met with a friend weekly to do science projects such as simple machines and flight kits from the Museum of Science. They also dissected owl pellets and explored the science of cooking amongst other things. Clyde also met weekly with a small group of kids to do &quot;detective science.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clyde took a great class at the Franklin Park Zoo that lasted the year. They covered a range of topics about the animals, the rainforest, and working in a zoo.</p>
      <p>Since January Clyde has volunteered at Habitat in Belmont doing herp care. He has lived up beautifully to the responsibility and has enjoyed getting to know the animals and how to care for them.</p>
      <p>In March, Clyde participated in the homeschoolers History/Geography Fair. His exhibit focused on Mexico. He was quite proud of the poster he made for it. The kids served homemade tortilla chips and salsa, played mariachi music, and helped other kids make gods' eyes. To prepare we read a lot about Mexico, Mexican history, including Aztecs and Mayans, and books about modern day Mexico. We were lucky enough to have a Mexican friend lend us some of her belongings to display in the exhibit. She told us many interesting stories about the different areas of Mexico.</p>
      <p>Both kids have been trying to keep up their Spanish by reading books and watching Spanish language videos. We are keeping our eyes open for a good teacher.</p>
      <p>Clyde continues to love to draw, and his drawings are becoming more sophisticated. He seems pleased with what he is able to produce.</p>
      <p>A newfound love of Clyde's is the piano. He can read music and practices for hours daily. His fascination with the instrument is extending to learning about various composers and styles of music.</p>
      <p>Clyde continues to be committed to karate. He is now a red belt, and is often used as an example of good form in class. He is very committed to this activity, practices at home, and focuses well in class.</p>
      <p>A partial list of field trips is appended.</p>
      <p>Partial list of books Clyde has read himself:</p>

      <p>Books we've read all together follow Bonnie's report.<br />
        <br />
      Bonnie Jones [8 years old]</p>
      <p>We read to Bonnie every day. Her own ability to read has reached a fluent level, though her comprehension outpaces her reading level. She still enjoys being read to, as well as listening to books on tape. We frequent the library, and a partial list of books we've read is attached.</p>
      <p>Bonnie understands how to read charts and graphs, how to use many different forms of measurement, and simple fractions. She understands how numbers progress through the hundreds. She is very confident in handling money, and can easily do sums in her head.</p>
      <p>Bonnie's handwriting is also improving as she gains confidence with both upper case and lower case letters.</p>
      <p>Bonnie was part of a small group of kids that met weekly to do various projects together. They explored weaving, sewing, beading, cooking, clay, nature walks, etc.</p>
      <p>Bonnie loves nature, and has a strong interest in and love of animals. This winter and spring she took a class at Habitat, which focused the first semester on birds, and the second on scents.</p>
      <p>Bonnie also participated in the homeschoolers History/Geography Fair. She and Clyde did a joint exhibit on Mexico.</p>
      <p>Bonnie is continuing to study Spanish through the use of books, tapes and videos.</p>
      <p>Bonnie started piano lessons and is learning quickly how to read music. We all enjoyed her recital last June.</p>
      <p>She was an enthusiastic participant in a dance class this year. The recital was a real production and she was quite professional with her commitment to it.</p>
      <p>Bonnie likes to play games on the computer, which reinforce reading and math skills.</p>
      <p>Some books we've read this year:</p>
