	      <li><span class="strong" id="laws">What are the education laws in Massachusetts?</span> Homeschooling in Massachusetts is primarily governed by the compulsory attendance statute (G.L. c 76, Sec. 1), and <em>Care and Protection of Charles</em>, a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling handed down in 1987. Oversight is at the level of local school districts. Read more at [Link to new page about law [HSLawataGlace formerly HSGuidelinesataGlance]. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
	      <li><span class="strong" id="edplan">What information has to be in my education plan?</span> The <em>Charles</em> court recognized that certain factors may be considered by the superintendent or school committee in determining whether or not to approve a home school proposal:
            <ul class="nested">
		               <li>the  proposed curriculum [i.e. the subjects], the length of the homeschool year and  the number of hours of instruction in each of the proposed subjects</li>
		               <li>the  competency of the parents to teach the children</li>
		               <li>access  to the textbooks, workbooks, and other instructional aids to be used by the  children and to the lesson plans and teaching manuals to be used by the parents</li>
		               <li>a  form of assessment of the children to ensure educational progress and the  attainment of minimum standards [Link  to SampleEdPlan]</li>
			  </ul><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li><span class="strong" id="curr">What about a curriculum?</span> Home school proposals are expected to be &ldquo;equal in thoroughness and efficiency&rdquo; to the instruction provided in public schools, but <em>Charles</em> does not make reference to or require the use of any specific materials or resources. [Link to Charles] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>        
           <li id="teacher"> <span class="strong">Do I have to be a certified teacher or have a college degree to homeschool my children?</span> No. <em>Charles</em> says “…[C]ertification would not appropriately be required for parents under a home school proposal… Nor must the parents have college or advanced academic degrees.” (<em>Charles</em> at 339) [Link to Charles]
           <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="eval"><span class="strong">What about evaluation?</span> <em>Charles</em> states that school officials and parents should agree on a  method of evaluation, which can include one of the following: standardized  testing, a periodic progress report, or dated work samples. [Link to Methods of Evaluation] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		   <li id="test"><span class="strong">Can testing be required?</span> The question of whether school officials can require testing of homeschoolers is not answered definitively in Massachusetts law. [Read more] <em>Charles</em> states that “…the superintendent  or school committee may properly require periodic standardized testing of the children to ensure educational progress and the attainment of minimum  standards.” (<em>Charles</em> at 339, 340). However, the decision goes on to say, “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the  parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340). It’s important to remember that testing was the chosen method of evaluation for the  family involved in the <em>Charles</em> case. It’s likely that when the court stated that standardized testing may be required, it was addressing (and answering “yes” to) the larger question of whether evaluation in general could be required. The fact that the court offers examples of other acceptable forms of evaluation, and stresses that they should  be “subject to the approval of the parents,” indicates that the intent was not  to allow schools the authority to dictate what type of evaluation families use. Rather, the intent is to allow parents to retain a choice in how their children  are evaluated. [http://www.ahem.info/Testing.html] <a href="#top">Back to top. </a></li>
           <li id="subjects"><span class="strong">Do I have to teach the same subjects as the public school?</span> Yes, but not on the same  schedule. For instance, a homeschooler could decide to cover all of high school  math in one year, and not do any math in other years. G.L. c. 69, section 1D  lists as core subjects mathematics, science and technology, history and social  science, English, foreign languages and the arts. Subjects from Chapter 71  Sections 1 and 3 include orthography, reading, writing, the English language  and grammar, geography, arithmetic, drawing, music, the history and  constitution of the United States, the duties of citizenship, health education,  physical education and good behavior. [Link to  Charles] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="commoncore"><span class="strong">Must my education plan align with the Common Core Standards?</span> No. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="sched"><span class="strong">Do I have to match the schedule of the public school?</span> No. Following a schedule is not  an important consideration in a home school where “...the perception and use of  time... are different ” (Brunelle at 518).  [Link to Brunelle] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="send"><span class="strong">How do I know where to send my education plan?</span> A school official is commonly designated to handle education plans. &nbsp;If a district does not specify an individual,  you should send your education plan via certified mail return receipt requested  to the superintendent’s office. <a href="#top">Back to top. </a></li>
           <li id="age"><span class="strong">At what age should I submit an education plan for my child?</span> You should submit your education plan in  the calendar year in which your child turns six. Families are required to continue reporting to their local school district until their child turns 16. Families may choose to continue to file education plans for specific purposes such as maintaining dual enrollment status at community colleges or to play public high school sports [http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr8.html] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="when"><span class="strong">When should I file my education plan?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Charles</em> does not specify any specific deadline for submitting an education  plan. Most families submit their education plans annually a few weeks before  the start of the school year. Parents who withdraw their child from school  should submit their education plan prior to withdrawing their child. [Link to Charles] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="meet"><span class="strong">Do I have to meet with school officials?</span> No. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="start"><span class="strong">How do I start homeschooling if my child is  already enrolled in school?</span> Submit an education plan as soon  as you decide to withdraw your child from school. You may decide to inform your child’s principal as a courtesy as well as to avoid potential misunderstandings or perceptions of truancy. If you have a specific question about this, contact  your AHEM contact. [Link to One-on-One Support] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="facilities"><span class="strong">Can I use school facilities, participate in public school classes and programs, and/or get educational materials from the schools?</span> Decisions regarding homeschoolers’ participation in any public school offerings are made at the discretion of local districts. [Link to Are Homeschoolers Entitled to Participate in Public School Classes and Activities?] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="sports"><span class="strong">Can my kids play high school sports at the public school?</span> The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA), a  private, not-for-profit organization organized by its member schools,  stipulates that homeschooled students are eligible to participate in  MIAA-sponsored interscholastic athletics if certain conditions are met. [Link to MIAABluebook.html] This policy removes obstacles to homeschoolers’ participation, but does not guarantee access. MIAA member schools still have the final say when it comes to allowing homeschooled students to join their athletic teams. [Link to Are  Homeschoolers Entitled to Participate in Public School Classes and Activities?] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="diploma"><span class="strong">Do homeschoolers get a diploma?</span> Home-schooled students are not  permitted to participate in the MCAS and, therefore, cannot attain a public  high school diploma. [Link to HighSchoolDiplomas.html] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="mcas"><span class="strong">What  about MCAS?</span> Homeschoolers are neither required, nor are they allowed, to take  MCAS. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="sped"><span class="strong">What if my child has special needs?</span> Most Massachusetts families with special needs children receive homeschool approval with little difficulty. The MA DESE confirms that eligible  Massachusetts homeschoolers have the right to special services through the  public schools if they desire them. [Link to HSandSPED.html] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="noresponse"><span class="strong">What happens if the school does not respond to a parent's proposed home education plan?</span> Send your education plan &ldquo;Return Receipt Requested&rdquo; or hand deliver it and ask for a signed receipt. Either  option provides verification that your materials were received. If you don&rsquo;t receive an approval letter, you can simply keep homeschooling. If you feel concerned about the lack of response from the school, check with other homeschoolers in your town. You may find out that it&rsquo;s routine for your  district not to provide formal approval. If a letter is important to you or necessary, you can request one. [Link to ApprovalLetters.html] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="notgood"><span class="strong">What happens if the school district says my plan isn&rsquo;t good enough?</span> If the school sees a problem  with your plan, they must detail the reasons, and give you the opportunity to  revise your plan to remedy it. If, having submitted a plan, you begin  homeschooling without approval, the school assumes the burden to show that your  plan does not equal &quot;in thoroughness and efficiency, and in the progress  made therein, that in the public schools in the same town....&quot; In&nbsp;<em>Charles,</em>&nbsp;the  court recommended for &quot;the parties… to proceed expeditiously in a serious  effort to resolve the matter by agreement.&quot; [Link  to Charles or Charles] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="homevisit"><span class="strong">Can home visits be required as a condition of approval of my home education plan?</span> No. [Link to Brunelle or Brunelle in  Brief] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="count"><span class="strong">Are homeschoolers included in the public school student  enrollment count?</span> No. Schools  receive no funding for homeschooled students located in their district. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="hiset"><span class="strong">Can homeschoolers take the HiSET (High School Equivalency  exam, formerly the GED)?</span> Yes. A homeschooler  age 16 or 17 can have the public school write a letter stating that he or she  is not enrolled, as he or she is (or has been) a homeschooler, and that letter  will qualify him or her to take the High School Equivalency Assessment. [Link to HighSchoolDiplomas.html] <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
           <li id="dese"><span class="strong">What is the role of the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education re: homeschooling?</span>  The Massachusetts Department of  Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove  homeschooling plans, and in fact plays no role whatsoever in the implementation  of homeschooling regulation in our state. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
