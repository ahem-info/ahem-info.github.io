			  <h2>Overreach, Reasonable . . . or Essential?</h2>
			<h3>What if your town asks for more?</h3>
		  <p>Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, there are “gray” areas. This does not mean, however, that we are without guidance. The law itself gives guidelines for what sorts of requests towns can make.  </p>
				<p>On the positive side, <em>Care and Protection of Charles</em> lays out four factors that may be considered in determining whether to approve a home education plan. These are: <a href="news-archives/2022/20220922_essential.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Events at Local Libraries</h2>
	<p>We recently sent out a survey to librarians across Massachusetts to see how their libraries serve the homeschooling community and what events they offer for homeschoolers. If your local library does not yet offer events and services for homeschoolers, please consider reaching out to point them to the AHEM website and to have them complete our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WKPTVGW">recent survey for librarians</a> so that we can follow up with them. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240516_lib_events.html">Read more ▸</a></p> 
 
				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: End-of-Year Evaluations</h2>
         <p>It's that time of  year. Many of us are finishing up one school year and thinking about reporting  for the next. Whether this is your first year reporting or you are an  experienced homeschooler, AHEM has answers to all your evaluation  questions. For more on each of these topics, please visit our website.</p>

				<h2 id="libsurv">HOMESCHOOLING AT THE LIBRARY</h2>
<p>This week we have something just for the librarians among you. We'd love to know what you are already doing for homeschoolers in your community and how AHEM can better help you to reach the homeschooling community.</p>

<p>**Please note that we are just looking for resposnes from Massaschusetts librarians this time. If you are not in that category, please do not take the survey but do consider passing it along to your local librarian and telling them about the work AHEM does.**</p>

				<h2>In Praise of Park Days</h2>
				<h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
			  <p>Park days have long been a staple of my family&rsquo;s homeschooling  life. With four kids, these informal, weekly gatherings have provided everyone  (even mom) with an opportunity to make friends and socialize in a way that no  co-op we found ever could. Park days were the one constant in our schedule from  year to year. (My high school age daughter did the recorded version of Spanish  3 because the live class would have interfered with park day. One has to have  priorities, you know.)</p>
				<p>Park days are a  melting pot. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240425_park.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Policy and Practice Survey Results</h2>
	     <p>Every year, AHEM sends out a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">survey</a> asking homeschoolers across the  state about their town’s homeschooling policies and about their  interactions with school officials.</p>
		     <p>
		     We use this information in two ways. As we answer questions through our <a href="one-on-one.html">One-on-One Contacts</a> program, we refer  to the database to see the experiences of other homeschoolers in a  given town. The responses also give us a snapshot of homeschooling policy and  practice trends over time so we can see if there are broad changes that are  occurring across the state.</p>
		     <p>Below are some of the  results from this year's questionnaire. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240411_pandp_survey_results.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Legislative Update - April 2024</h2>
         <p>Our Massachusetts Legislature began its 193rd session on January  4, 2023. Below is a summary of bills filed this session that AHEM is following.  At this time no action needs to be taken on any of these bills.<a href="news-archives/2024/20240404_leg_update.html"> Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Survey Results: Homeschooling Books and Resources</h2>
			  <p>Recently, we asked you what books or other resources influenced your decision to homeschool. Thank you to all who responded.</p>

				<h2>Help Getting Started Homeschooling in Massachusetts</h2>
		   <p>We begin to see a spike in new homeschoolers this time of year.

Whatever your reason for homeschooling, the AHEM website has everything you need to get started homeschooling in Massachusetts. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240321_getting_started.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

				<h2>Home with Kids 24/7</h2>
			  <p><em>With the cold, sloppy New England winter dragging on, it seemed like a good time to reshare this article from our archives.  We hope that it will encourage you, whether you are new to homeschooling, a veteran, or just considering.</em> </p>

				<p><strong>By Sophia Sayigh</strong></p>
				<p>Maybe you have subscribed to our list or are visiting our website because you have decided unexpectedly to homeschool and now find yourself at home all day with your kids. Here I draw on the wisdom of practicing homeschoolers with tips for managing your day. Trying to recreate school at home can be stressful. And goodness knows, none of us need more stress in our lives. So here is a short list of tips for being around your kids 24/7 that have been successful strategies for many a homeschooling family: <a href="news-archives/2021/20210913_24-7.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
<h2>AHEM Needs YOU!</h2>
		   <h3>Your skills,  expertise, and helping hands!</h3>
           <p>AHEM is <q>staffed</q> by a handful of currently homeschooling or  formerly homeschooling parent volunteers. To stay viable, we need young  families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent homeschooling  as an educational option to step up. Help out in order for Massachusetts homeschoolers   to keep the right to homeschool the way they want to homeschool.</p>
  <h4>Several opportunities are available: <a href="news-archives/2024/20240215_vols.html">Read more ▸</a></h4>

				                  
<h2>Resources for Homeschooling High School</h2>
		   <p>Whether you already have  teens or are just planning the future, some of the most common questions  we get are: <q>What about high school?</q> <q>Can my homeschooled child get into  college?</q> <q>How can my child access standardized testing?</q> <q>How do they get a diploma  and how can I create a transcript?</q>
           </p>
           <p>The good news is that <a href="news-archives/2023/20231012_grad.html">our surveys</a> show that high schoolers who were  homeschooled thrive in the next stage of life. And our <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> has all the  information you will need to help them get there. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240201_hshs_resources.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>"Hybrid" Homeschooling</h2>              
		   <p>More and more frequently we are seeing questions about<q>hybrid homeschooling,</q> the idea being that someone can homeschool but drop their child off at some kind of <q>program,</q> either for a few days a week or full-time. Others when speaking of <q>hybrid</q> schooling may mean homeschooling    while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a coop, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>
              <p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in Massachusetts. You are either enrolled in school, or you are not. When a homeschooler takes classes at a public school, the school does not receive per pupil funding for that student. Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible for an enrolled student to work out an arrangement with their school to do part of their schooling at home, but this would be up to individual schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you&rsquo;re either in or you&rsquo;re out.</p>
                           <p>
                           As long as there have been homeschoolers, they have chosen to use the resources of their community to augment their experiences. Many    museums, nature sanctuaries, tutoring centers, private instructors, performing arts organizations, and libraries offer classes and       activities for homeschoolers. The availability of homeschoolers to enroll in programs during daytime hours offers opportunities to        fill otherwise empty spaces. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240125_hybrid.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
              <h2>Unsnarling <em>Charles</em></h2>
		   <p>Understanding  Massachusetts homeschooling law is not a straightforward undertaking. Yet it is  an important one. Once you understand your rights, you can stand up for them.  Homeschooling in Massachusetts is a purely local undertaking, with each  district performing oversight functions. (The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove homeschooling plans, and in  fact, plays no role whatsoever in the implementation of homeschooling regulation  in our state.) The following is our own interpretation of <em><a href="charles.html">Charles's</a></em> intent  regarding issues such as prior approval, written approval, evaluation, mid-year  changes, and testing, and does not constitute legal advice; it is for  informational purposes only. <a href="unsnarling_charles.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>The S-Word</h2> 
		   <h3>How to Think About the Socialization Question</h3>
<h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I’d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one’s  ability to be relational—to form,   build, and negotiate relationships. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220811_sword.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
       
				<h2>Word Cloud</h2>
<h3>A look at the topics tackled by our One-on-One Contacts in 2023</h3>
	<p>If you have ever sent a homeschool question to AHEM, chances are good someone  in the community has had a similar question. According to the numbers,  the most frequently used words in 2023 were: homeschool (46%), district  (34%), education plan (24%), approval (12%), application (11%),  superintendent (8%), services (7%), register (6%), and IEP (5%).</p>
  <p>AHEM’s one-on-one volunteers offer information and engage with you to address  each question, whether you are just looking into homeschooling,  withdrawing mid-year and wondering if your district needs to approve your  plan before you start, or need a sounding board for how to respond to your  school district. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240104_word_cloud.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
