<h2>Resources for Homeschooling High School</h2>
		   <p>Whether you already have  teens or are just planning the future, some of the most common questions  we get are: <q>What about high school?</q> <q>Can my homeschooled child get into  college?</q> <q>How can my child access standardized testing?</q> <q>How do they get a diploma  and how can I create a transcript?</q>
           </p>
           <p>The good news is that <a href="news-archives/2023/20231012_grad.html">our surveys</a> show that high schoolers who were  homeschooled thrive in the next stage of life. And our <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> has all the  information you will need to help them get there. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240201_hshs_resources.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>"Hybrid" Homeschooling</h2>              
		   <p>More and more frequently we are seeing questions about<q>hybrid homeschooling,</q> the idea being that someone can homeschool but drop their child off at some kind of <q>program,</q> either for a few days a week or full-time. Others when speaking of <q>hybrid</q> schooling may mean homeschooling    while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a coop, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>
              <p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in Massachusetts. You are either enrolled in school, or you are not. When a homeschooler takes classes at a public school, the school does not receive per pupil funding for that student. Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible for an enrolled student to work out an arrangement with their school to do part of their schooling at home, but this would be up to individual schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you&rsquo;re either in or you&rsquo;re out.</p>
                           <p>
                           As long as there have been homeschoolers, they have chosen to use the resources of their community to augment their experiences. Many    museums, nature sanctuaries, tutoring centers, private instructors, performing arts organizations, and libraries offer classes and       activities for homeschoolers. The availability of homeschoolers to enroll in programs during daytime hours offers opportunities to        fill otherwise empty spaces. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240125_hybrid.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
              <h2>Unsnarling <em>Charles</em></h2>
		   <p>Understanding  Massachusetts homeschooling law is not a straightforward undertaking. Yet it is  an important one. Once you understand your rights, you can stand up for them.  Homeschooling in Massachusetts is a purely local undertaking, with each  district performing oversight functions. (The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove homeschooling plans, and in  fact, plays no role whatsoever in the implementation of homeschooling regulation  in our state.) The following is our own interpretation of <em><a href="charles.html">Charles's</a></em> intent  regarding issues such as prior approval, written approval, evaluation, mid-year  changes, and testing, and does not constitute legal advice; it is for  informational purposes only. <a href="unsnarling_charles.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>The S-Word</h2> 
		   <h3>How to Think About the Socialization Question</h3>
<h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I’d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one’s  ability to be relational—to form,   build, and negotiate relationships. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220811_sword.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
       
				<h2>Word Cloud</h2>
<h3>A look at the topics tackled by our One-on-One Contacts in 2023</h3>
	<p>If you have ever sent a homeschool question to AHEM, chances are good someone  in the community has had a similar question. According to the numbers,  the most frequently used words in 2023 were: homeschool (46%), district  (34%), education plan (24%), approval (12%), application (11%),  superintendent (8%), services (7%), register (6%), and IEP (5%).</p>
  <p>AHEM’s one-on-one volunteers offer information and engage with you to address  each question, whether you are just looking into homeschooling,  withdrawing mid-year and wondering if your district needs to approve your  plan before you start, or need a sounding board for how to respond to your  school district. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240104_word_cloud.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
