			 <h2 id="weston">Getting Started Homeschooling in Massachusetts: Virtual          Presentation </h2>
		   <h4>Wednesday, February 9, 2022, 7:00-8:30 pm</h4>
                           <p>Whether you are actively considering home education or are just curious          about how it is done, you are invited to attend Getting Started          Homeschooling. The free virtual program will be sponsored by the Weston          Public Library on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, 7:00-8:30 pm</p>
                           <p>Topics to be covered include an overview of homeschooling, getting          started, methods, resources, and homeschooling support. There will be          time for questions and discussion.</p>
              <p>The program will be presented by Roberta Van Vlack. Roberta is the          mother of four children who have always been homeschooled. Two are          currently in high school and two are in college. She has used eclectic          and Charlotte Mason methods in her homeschool. She's a board          member of Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, moderates the Attleboro Area Homeschool group, and blogs about education at <a href="https://lettersfromnebby.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Letters from Nebby</a>.</p>

				<h2>Help Getting Started Homeschooling </h2>
		   <p>Whether          you are starting in August or jumping in mid-year, the AHEM website has          everything you need to get started homeschooling in Massachusetts. The          first step to start officially homeschooling is to submit an          education plan to your local school superintendent or school committee. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220106_help.html">Read more. &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
				<h2>The Year in Review from AHEM!</h2>
				<h4>Please consider AHEM when you are making <a href="support.html">end-of-year charitable donations!</a></h4>
<h3>Highlights of 2021</h3>
			  <p>2021 saw sustained interest in homeschooling. While not as busy as 2020, you can see in the chart below that in 2021, we still had increased visits to our website compared to the years prior to the pandemic.</p>

<h3>AHEM provided:</h3>
				<ul class="nested">
				  <li>Virtual <a href="outreach.html">presentations</a>, hosted by AHEM or local libraries, including <em>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</em> and <em>Pop-Up Virtual Homeschooling Q&amp;A</em></li>
				  <li>Articles clarifying homeschool policy and practice, sometimes confounding to homeschoolers, new and experienced: <a href="news-archives/2021/20211209_year_in_review.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Conform to Forms?: "Grey" Areas in the Law</h2>
<p>With so many new homeschoolers, AHEM has been seeing an uptick in questions about approval and other issues. Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, not by statutes, there is a lot that is not clearly laid out or that is open to interpretation. The following article attempts to unravel some of the murkier areas. We encourage all homeschoolers to read the <a href="ma_hs_law.html">court decisions</a>, which can be found on our website, for themselves. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

                             <h4>by Carol Moxley</h4>
              <h3>You did it!</h3>
		   <p>You made the decision to homeschool, and you found other          homeschoolers to help enrich your homeschooling experience. Great! But,          for some reason, you still feel like you're always on the periphery of          the group. Approaching a cluster of moms at park day is awkward; asking          to be included in a co-op is unthinkable; having a real friend to call          up on the phone is still out of reach. The support you need has to be          there somewhere—others seem to have found it—but how do you go about          forming the network you so desperately need? <a href="news-archives/2021/20211202_i_sought.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
