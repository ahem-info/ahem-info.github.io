				<h2>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h2>
<p>This time of year we begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are being asked for a midyear report. </p> 
				<h4>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable form of evaluation.</h4>
<p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES & others,</em></a> 399 Mass. 324 (1987) clearly outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility. <a href="progress_reports.html">Read more >></a></p>

				<h2>Homeschooling Fact Check: Materials and Resources</h2>
				<p><em>This week we continue our <q>Homeschooling Fact Check</q> series in which we examine some of the most common questions we receive and some of the biggest myths about homeschooling in Massachusetts.  If you have questions or topics you'd like to suggest for this series, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Fact Check Suggestion">info@ahem.info</a>.</em>  </p>

			  <h2>Unsnarling Charles</h2>
		   <p>Understanding  Massachusetts homeschooling law is not a straightforward undertaking. Yet it is  an important one. Once you understand your rights, you can stand up for them.  Homeschooling in Massachusetts is a purely local undertaking, with each  district performing oversight functions. (The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove homeschooling plans, and in  fact, plays no role whatsoever in the implementation of homeschooling regulation  in our state.) The following is our own interpretation of <em><a href="charles.html">Charles's</a></em> intent  regarding issues such as prior approval, written approval, evaluation, mid-year  changes, and testing, and does not constitute legal advice; it is for  informational purposes only. <a href="unsnarling_charles.html">Read more >></a></p>
			 
					  <h2>Homeschooling High School FAQ</h2>
		   <h3>Reporting</h3>
	     <h4>If I am withdrawing my child from high school to homeschool, what do I need to do?</h4>
		   <p>You can withdraw your child and begin homeschooling at any age and at any point in the school year. If your child is under 16, see <em><a href="../../getting_started.html">Getting Started Homeschooling</a></em> for how to submit an education plan.</p>
<p>If your child is 16 or older, you do not have to submit an education plan, but you should officially withdraw your child. If your child has done some high school, obtain a copy of their transcript when you withdraw. 
</p>
	     <h4>My child turned 16 mid-year. Do I need to send in my end-of-year evaluation?</h4>
	     <p>No. The day your child turns 16 you can be done reporting. <a href="news-archives/2022/20221117_hs_faq.html">Read more >></a></p>
		

		 <h2>Results of Education Plan Submission Survey</h2>
	<h3>October 2022</h3>
		<p>Thanks to all who took time out of their day to fill out the survey. The survey collected data about the use of forms to submit education plans. 369 homeschoolers from half of all municipalities in Massachusetts responded.</p>
