		  <h2><q>Hybrid Homeschooling</q></h2>
		   <p>The term <q>hybrid homeschooling</q> is being bandied about a lot this summer, one  idea being that someone can homeschool but drop their child off at some kind of  <q>program</q> for one or two days a week, or more. Other definitions might be  homeschooling while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a  coop, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200723_hybrid_hs.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Isabella Watkins</h2>
				<img src="images/watkins.jpg" alt=""/>
<p><strong>By Isabella Watkins</strong></p>
         <p>My parents and I only intended to homeschool while I was in  fifth grade, then I would go back to my old school for sixth, seventh, and  eighth grades.</p>
         <p>On the first day of fifth grade, I woke up at around eight  in the morning, made teacher nametags for my parents and a student one for  myself, and sat down at the table in my room with every intention of recreating  the school environment. This routine lasted about four or five days, until my  parents surprised me with the question: <q>What would you like to do today?</q> <a href="news-archives/2020/20200709_watkins.html">Read more.</a></p>

<h3>LIFE SCHOOLING</h3>
         <p><strong>By Anne Kern</strong></p>
         
         <p>In the late summer of 2018—with excitement and  some trepidation—I drove out to western Massachusetts with my homeschooled  daughter Jamila and watched her begin her college career. Had homeschooling  prepared her well enough? Was she as academically fit as the schooled students?  Was this the end of homeschooling? <a href="news-archives/2020/20200625_kern.html">Read more.</a></p>
			  <h2>Student Charlie Cards</h2>

				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Jordan Kammeyer</h2>
             <img src="images/kammeyer.jpg" alt=""/>
<p><strong>By Jordan Kammeyer</strong></p>
         
         <p>Why would a straight-A student who loved school decide to  leave it after ninth grade?</p>
         <p>My name is Jordan, and I am a 17-year-old high school  senior. I am the oldest of five children, and I live on a two-acre homestead in  the Berkshires of Massachusetts. Here we have raised chickens, sheep, rabbits,  and pigs, and have been homeschooling for the past several years. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200611_kammeyer.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Yeracaris Family</h2>

<h3>Reflections on a Homeschooling Adventure</h3>
		   <p><strong>By Janet Yeracaris</strong></p>
         <p>When my husband and I got married, we bought a house in a town  with excellent schools, fully intending to have our kids educated by the public  system. By the time we had two actual children, and I was seeing how they were  growing and learning, how creative and quick and inventive they could be, I  thought, <q>We&rsquo;ll see how this school thing goes.</q> I knew that most schools,  regardless of how well funded, are very box-like, and there is a great deal of <q>fitting-in</q> that must be done to be successful in that environment. Sure enough, as each of  them started elementary school, it became clear to me that they were likely to  thrive being cut loose to learn in their own time and in their own way. I  already knew other homeschoolers, and the leap to a home-based education was  not a big one. We left the box behind and set off for adventure. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200525_yeracaris.html">Read more.</a></p>				
				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Blessed Family</h2> 
				<img src="images/blessed.jpg" alt=""/>
<p><strong>By DommiesBlessed</strong></p>
			  <p>“Where’s the schooling? Where’s the structure?”</p>
<p>I could feel my throat tightening as my husband and father to our three girls asked me what seemed to be rhetorical questions. Why can’t he see that our children are happy, healthy, and brilliant? Has he read their monthly progress notes where I document their growth? Has he asked them what they are most proud of this week? What’s wrong with them playing with their dolls, studying on YouTube, gaming on Roblox, and building on Minecraft? <a href="news-archives/2020/20200507_blessed.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Rubin Family</h2> 
				<img src="images/rubin20200423.jpg" alt=""/>
<p><strong>By Robin Rubin</strong></p>
				<p>The first time I heard anyone mention homeschooling was when I was pregnant with my first child, back in 2003. During a pre-natal exercise class, one of the mothers mentioned that her family was going to be attending a homeschooling conference soon (her older child was around 5 years old). Intrigued, I asked her why they were homeschooling. She said because they did not want to rush childhood. I thought that was interesting, and it turned out to be a comment I would never forget. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200423_rubin.html">Read more.</a></p>
			  <h2>Yum: A Bite-Sized and Nourishing Homeschooling Strategy for All Ages</h2>

<h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
				<p>Are  you struggling with the kids home full-time since schools closed, or were already  homeschooling but are feeling the effects of being cooped up without the usual  access to the whole wide world? Everyone, school families and  homeschoolers alike, are feeling the strain of not being able to get together  with friends and loved ones. To you I offer this strategy to reset life at home  under the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/dph-public-health-advisory-stay-at-home-advisory" target="_blank">stay-at-home  advisory</a>. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200416_yum.html">Read more.</a></p>

<p><strong>By  Patricia Zarate Perez</strong></p>
         <p>With almost 60 million Latin@s living in the United States, it  is very possible one such family is homeschooling in Massachusetts. Los Perez,  with mother Patricia from Chile, father Danilo from Panama, and children  Daniela (16), Carolina (14), and Danilo Andres (9) have lived in a liminal  space for decades.&nbsp;In the intersection of the LatinX immigrant community,  the academic circles of Boston, and the musical world of Berklee College,  homeschooling is at the core of our values. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200402_perez.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>HOME WITH KIDS IN THE TIME OF COVID-19</h2>
              <img src="images/outside.jpg" alt=""/>
<p>Maybe you have subscribed to our list or are visiting our website because you have unexpectedly found yourself at home all day with your kids. You may have seen some blog posts and articles with suggestions for how to manage having kids around all day. I know I have. Some pressure parents to impose school-like schedules on kids so that kids won’t fall behind. Here I have tried to draw on the wisdom of practicing homeschoolers in these difficult times. Trying to recreate school at home can be stressful. And goodness knows, none of us need more stress in our lives right now. So here is a short list of tips for being around your kids 24/7 that have been successful strategies for many a homeschooling family. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200316_covid_19.html">Read more.</a></p>
