			 		   <h2>Tips and Tricks for CLEP Exams</h2>
         <p><strong>By Emma Smith</strong> </p>
           <p><em>Editor&rsquo;s Note:</em> <em>The College Level Examination Program® (CLEP) is a series of exams  offered by the College Board. Students who take these exams may be able to get  college credit which can save tuition dollars in the long run. These exams can  be taken before college but also while the student is in college. The  information below presents the experience of one young woman. Because policies  may change, you should check the College Board website for updated  information.</em></p>
           <p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of multiple-choice tests but I have had very good  luck with CLEPs. You usually only need a 50/80 to pass, which is roughly a C,  so it is a good option for someone who does <q>meh</q> but good enough on  standardized tests. If you fail, you can retake any exam after waiting  three months. As I have been taking CLEP exams, I have been steadily  improving my confidence for standardized tests which is awesome because I was  pretty bad at them. I have taken two tests so far and I plan on taking four to  five more. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210909_clep.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>Homeschooling Styles</h2>
			  <h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
                <p>One of the most frequent questions we receive from new  homeschoolers is: <q>How do I do the academics?</q> The short answer is: <q>However  you like!</q> In Massachusetts we have a lot of leeway in terms of what, when, and  how to teach. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210826_styles.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>Town Point People</h2>
				<p>AHEM is building a list of town- or school district-specific point people to help homeschooling families connect with others in town. These volunteers are eager to meet others in town. <a href="tpp.html">Read more here</a> if you want to be connected to the Town Point Person in your town or if you would like to find out more about being a Town Point Person yourself.

  		      <h2>Homeschool Policies in Massachusetts: An Overview</h2>
		   <p>AHEM  offers this clarification of the role of homeschool policies in towns in  Massachusetts. While unsatisfactory policies can occasionally create nuisances  for homeschoolers, they are not a huge problem in Massachusetts. Under our  current law, the only policy that counts is <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a>.</em> While homeschoolers within their own towns  can have good experiences working with school officials, build bridges, develop positive relationships, and educate school officials about <em>Charles</em> and homeschooling in general, a policy that exceeds <em>Charles</em> is not in and  of itself a threat to homeschooling freedoms, and does not automatically signify an unreasonable superintendent. <a href="hs_policies.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>Tips for Writing Your Education Plan</h2>
			  <h3 id="compulsory">COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE STATUTE</h3>
			  <p>In Massachusetts, there is no statute specifically governing homeschooling. Rather, the Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld the compulsory attendance statute which states that <q>Every child between the minimum and maximum ages established for school attendance by the board of education, … shall, subject to section fifteen, attend a public day school in said town, or some other day school approved by the school committee,… but such attendance shall not be required of a child… who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee.</q> (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter76/Section1" target="_blank">Mass General Laws, Chapter 76, section 1</a>) <a href="tips.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>Student Charlie Cards 2021</h2>
		   <p>The MBTA issues student fare  media to middle school and high school aged homeschoolers for use on the MBTA  system. In August, they will be issuing student Charlie Cards for the 2021-2022 Academic School Year. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210805_student_charlie_cards.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>Conform to Forms?</h2>
              <p>Although  it is not required to fill out a school-generated form to homeschool in  Massachusetts, some school officials find that forms make their lives easier,  and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more. </a></p>
<h2>AHEM Networking Forum</h2>
         <p>In an attempt to harness  the power of technology in service of connection, the AHEM Networking Forum was created to  facilitate families in different parts of Massachusetts to meet in person and  get to know each other. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210520_forum.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>To Meet or Not to Meet?</h2>
		   <p>Many          homeschoolers in Massachusetts are currently in the process of          submitting the method of evaluation outlined in their approved          education plans. According to <a href="news-archives/2019/20190711_policy_and_practice_analysis.html">AHEM’s          database</a>, for most that will          be a <a href="methods_eval.html">progress          report</a>, but others may use <a href="methods_eval.html">test          results or dated work samples</a>.          In this unusual homeschooling year, we’ve learned that some districts          are asking to meet with homeschooling parents, and in some cases          children, in order to perform their oversight function. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210624_meetings.html">Read more.</a></p>

		   <h4>Your          skills, expertise, and helping hands!</h4>
              <p>AHEM          is <q>staffed</q> by a small handful of currently homeschooling or formerly          homeschooling parent volunteers. To stay viable, we need young          families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent          homeschooling as an educational option to step up and help out if          Massachusetts homeschoolers are to keep the right to homeschool          the way they want to homeschool.</p>

<p>Reissuing this piece from almost a year ago. Hoping it can act as a bit of a pressure valve, especially during these long winter days when homeschool burnout tends to rear its head.</p>
<h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
         <p>Maybe you have subscribed to our list or are visiting our  website because you have unexpectedly found yourself at home all day with your  kids. You may have seen some blog posts and articles with suggestions for how  to manage having kids around all day. I know I have. Some pressure parents to  impose school-like schedules on kids so that kids won&rsquo;t <q>fall behind.</q> Here I  have tried to draw on the wisdom of practicing homeschoolers in these difficult  times. Trying to recreate school at home can be stressful. And goodness knows,  none of us need more stress in our lives right now. So here is a short list of  tips for being around your kids 24/7 that have been successful strategies for  many a homeschooling family: <a href="news-archives/2020/20200316_covid_19.html">Read more.</a></p>		   
			  <h2>A Brief History of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</h2>
		   <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		   <p>Massachusetts has no statute that specifically addresses homeschooling. Rather, homeschooling is governed by case law, in conjunction with applicable statutes. The most important case is <em><a href="charles.html">Care and Protection of Charles &amp; others</a></em>, 399 Mass. 324 (1987). In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the compulsory attendance statute, General Laws Chapter 76, Section 1. In its decision, the Court was aware of the need to balance two basic tenets—the constitutional right of the parents to homeschool and the state’s interest in the education of its citizenry. The result was delegation of homeschooling oversight to local school districts. <a href="history.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2 id="nuts">Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</h2>
			  <p><strong>Thursday,  February 4, 2021, 6:30 – 8:00 pm</strong></p>
                <p>Whether you are actively considering home education or are just  curious about how it is done, you are invited to attend <em>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in  Massachusetts.</em> The free virtual program will be sponsored by the Amesbury  Public Library, 149 Main St,  Amesbury, MA on Thursday, February 4, 2021, 6:30 – 8:00 pm.</p>
                <p>This workshop will cover Massachusetts homeschool  guidelines; the history of homeschooling in MA; writing your education plan;  choosing a form of evaluation; and local homeschool policies. There will be  plenty of time for questions and discussion.</p>
                <p>The program will be presented by Milva McDonald. Milva is  the mother of four adult children, all of whom homeschooled for all or most of  their childhood and teenage years. She began homeschooling in 1991, after  reading an essay by John Taylor Gatto and realizing school and the PTA weren't  for her. She's a co-founder of Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts,  and served as a support group leader, field trip organizer, and potluck host  for many joyful homeschooling years. Her books include <em><a href="resources.html">Slow Homeschooling</a></em> and <em><a href="resources.html">Unschoolers.</a></em> She blogs at <a href="https://apotlucklife.com/" target="_blank">www.apotlucklife.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Admission is free, but <a href="https://www.eventkeeper.com/code/ekform.cfm?curOrg=AMESBURY&curID=485543" target="_blank">preregistration is required</a>.</p>
                <p>Space is limited and spots are allotted on a first come,  first served basis.</p>
                <p>Please respect AHEM&rsquo;s  mission to empower individuals through education by not soliciting for your  business at this event. </p>
