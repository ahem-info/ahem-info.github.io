				<p>Thank you so much if you've already responded to our year-end appeal. If you haven't there's still time to make a <a href="support.html">2023 tax-deductible donation</a> to AHEM! Read on...</p>
<p>Dear AHEM Friends,</p>
  <p>Twenty years ago, on the floor of a gymnasium during indoor  homeschool gym time, AHEM was brought to life by a group of passionate  homeschooling mothers with the goal to maintain the right to independently  homeschool and strengthen the grassroots presence of homeschoolers in  Massachusetts. <a href="news-archives/2023/20231228_appeal.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

				<h2>A Plethora of Resources</h2>
         
         <h3>Navigating AHEM's Website &amp;  Finding the Help You Need</h3>
           <p>Advocates for Home Education in  Massachusetts (AHEM) has been helping homeschoolers in Massachusetts for two  decades now. In that time, we have heard a lot of stories, answered a lot of  questions, and accumulated a lot of resources. While we feel we have a lot to  offer, we also understand that it can be a lot to navigate, whether you are  brand new to homeschooling or an old-timer looking for the answer to a  particular question.</p>
         <p>To aid in the process, we offer the  following quick guide to finding what you need on the AHEM website: <a href="news-archives/2023/20231116_plethora.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Fact Check: Pre-Approval</h2>
				<p><em>This week we continue our <q>Homeschooling Fact Check</q> series in which we examine some of the most common questions we receive and some of the biggest myths about homeschooling in Massachusetts.  If you have questions or topics you'd like to suggest for this series, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Fact Check Suggestion">info@ahem.info</a>.</em>  </p>
	
			  <h3>Claim:</h3> 

	<p>You need to get your education plan approved before withdrawing a child from school to homeschool.</p>
								
	<h3>Reading the Law:</h3> 
	<p> The General Laws of the State of Massachusetts refer to <q>a child who is being otherwise instructed in a manner <em>approved in advance</em> by the superintendent or the school committee</q> [<a href="chapter_76.html">Mass. G.L. Chapter 76, Section 1</a>; emphasis added]. <a href="news-archives/2023/20231109_fact_8.html">Read more ▸ </a>
				<h2>Survey Results: End-of-Year Evaluations</h2>
		   <p>In July, AHEM sent out a survey asking you all about your end-of-year evaluations including what form of evaluation you chose and how your town responded. We are happy to say that the situation in Massachusetts seems to be little changed in this regard. Most homeschoolers choose to submit a progress report and receive neutral or positive feedback from their districts.</p> 

<p>Altogether we received 270 responses. The vast majority, just over 80%, of respondents reported that they submitted a progress report as their end-of-year evaluation for the 2022-2023 school year.

<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Bautistas</h2>
	          <img src="images/bautista.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>by Juan  Bautista</h4>
      <p>As parents we always look for the best for our kids. I remember  not knowing anything about homeschooling but desperately looking for some way  of education other than the conventional routes that are not working and fail  students over and over.</p>
      <p>I remember meeting AHEM parents during a workshop at a hotel in  Danvers, MA, ten years ago. This was a small community of parents hungry to  learn from each other. That was when we found information that inspired and  encouraged us to keep going on this path.</p>
      <p>My daughter Biby is now at UMass-Lowell. She was accepted with  honors and is pursuing a career in Music Education. She started by taking  summer classes just to adapt to college life and to ease her own fears and  ended the program with straight A's. As a homeschooler she was used to learning  one subject for an entire day or reading an entire book for hours till she  finished it, skills she used trying to cover her general education  requirements. <a href="news-archives/2023/20231019_bautista.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
      
			  <h2>Survey Results: Homeschool Graduates</h2>
		<p>Recently, AHEM sent out a survey asking those of you who  have graduated students from your homeschool what they did next and what are  doing now. We are happy to report that your homeschool graduates are thriving  and are involved in some really interesting ventures.</p>
        <p>Altogether we got 63 responses to our survey. Of these 37,  or 58%, went on immediately to a four-year college. What about the others? In  roughly equal numbers they entered the work force (13%), enrolled in a  community college (10%) or took a gap year (11%). And there were a few with  different paths -- we had one respondent each for: entered the military,  enrolled in a trade school, did missions/volunteer work, started their own  business, and worked as an au pair abroad. </p>
        <p>Beyond the statistics, we asked you to brag about your  graduates and to tell us what they have done that you or they are proud of. Not  surprisingly, many parents took us up on this offer. Below are some of the  inspiring answers we received. <a href="news-archives/2023/20231012_grad.html">Read more ▸ </a> </p>
				<h2 id="pandp">AHEM Questionnaire on Homeschooling Policy and Practice</h2>
				<p>Every year we do surveys to see what issues homeschoolers in Massachusetts are having and how reporting requests have changed from year to year. Whether you have had issues reporting in your town or not, your responses help us. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">Please consider taking a few minutes to respond.</a> Results will be published in an upcoming AHEM newsletter.</p>
				<h2>Legislative Update - September 2023</h2>
         <p>Our Massachusetts Legislature began its 193nd session on January 4, 2023. Below is a summary of bills filed this session that AHEM is following. At this time no action needs to be taken on any of these bills. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230928_leg_update.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2 id="outcome">Homeschool Graduate Outcomes</h2>
				<p>Have you graduated a student from homeschool? We'd love to hear what they did next and what they are up to. Now is your chance to brag! If you have more than one graduate, feel free to complete the survey for each. Responses may be used in future AHEM emails and on the AHEM website and social media sites.</p>

		<p>As their neighbors buy new lunch boxes and notebooks and worry about adjusting sleep schedules and who's going to get junior off the bus this year, many homeschoolers find themselves breathing a sigh of relief. Finally, our favorite museums and parks will be less crowded again! Whether you stick to the traditional school-year calendar or take a more free-form approach, the end of summer is the perfect time to get outdoors and to fully enjoy the flexibility that homeschooling affords. Not-back-to-school events are a way to connect with others and to celebrate the freedom that homeschooling gives. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230831_nbts.html">Read more ▸</a></p> 

				<h2>Overreach, Reasonable . . . or Essential?</h2>
			<h4>What if your town asks for more?</h4>
		  <p>Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, there are “gray” areas. This does not mean, however, that we are without guidance. The law itself gives guidelines for what sorts of requests towns can make.  </p>
				<p>On the positive side, <em>Care and Protection of Charles</em> lays out four factors that may be considered in determining whether to approve a home education plan. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220922_essential.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2 id="millbury">Upcoming Presentation: The Nuts &amp; Bolts of Homeschooling</h2>

				<h2 id="tpp">Connecting with Others: Town Point People</h2>
			  <p><em>Would you like to  help connect homeschooling families in your town or area? Are you wondering who  is new in your area, or how you can support new families?</em> </p>
				  <p>AHEM keeps a list of  local, independent volunteers known as <a href="tpp.html">Town Point People (TPPs)</a>. The purpose of  TPPs is social. TPPs help homeschoolers make local connections  and find resources and groups near them. There are more than 300 towns in Massachusetts. The sidebar <a href="tpp.html">on this page</a> lists towns we've got covered so  far but there are lots more out there and we need your help to make sure all  homeschoolers in MA can be connected with someone local.</p>
				  <p>If your town is listed, <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">get in touch</a> and we can connect  you to the TPP in your town.</p>
				  <p>If your town isn't listed yet, that means we are still  looking for a local contact. If you would like to find out  more about being a TPP yourself, <a href="tpp.html">read more here</a>.</p>

              <p>In this day and age, homeschoolers represent a market. There are many businesses catering to homeschoolers&rsquo; needs—or perceived needs. When first starting out it can be especially tempting to sign up for a multitude of classes or experiences rather than putting your energy into a grassroots network such as a local homeschool support group. Before you know it, your days are filled with activity and you don&rsquo;t look back.</p>
	                            <p>The intangibles you’d be missing out on—real connection with other homeschoolers and personal empowerment—might be some of the best kept secrets of homeschooling, as well as what would sustain you on this path in the end. It’s worth putting some time and effort in, and yes, if shy, getting your courage up, to figure out how to insinuate   yourself into a group of homeschoolers, rather than filling your day with activities that leave you with a busy day void of meaningful relationships. <a href="news-archives/2021/20211021_why_and_how.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
	                            
			  <h2>Step One: DON'T PANIC</h2>
<p>The guidebook known as  <em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (from the novel of the same name) is said  to have on its cover these words: DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</p>
  <p>If I were making a guidebook on homeschool reporting, I  would take a page (pun intended) from Douglas Adams and start the same  way.</p>
  <p>Maybe your town has a new homeschool policy. Maybe they are  making requests they never have before. Maybe instead of approving your  education plan, they are asking for more information. Maybe you are just new  and nervous about sending in your first education plan.</p>
  <p>Whatever your situation, the first step is the  same:<strong> DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</strong></p>

				<h2>Legislative Update - June 2023</h2>
         <p>Our Massachusetts Legislature began its 193nd session on January 4, 2023. Below is a summary of bills filed this session that AHEM is following. At this time no action needs to be taken on any of these bills.</p>

				<h2>Conform to Forms: Should You Fill Out Your Town's Application?</h2>
				<p>One of the most frequent questions AHEM gets is about forms or applications. Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, not by statutes, there is a lot that is not clearly laid out or that is open to interpretation. The following is a republication of an article from the AHEM website which attempts to unravel one of the murkier areas. We encourage all homeschoolers to read the <a href="ma_hs_law.html">court decisions</a>, which can be found on our website, for themselves. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more ▸ </a> </p>
				<h2>Help Getting Started Homeschooling</h2>
			<p>As one school year ends  and another is in view, many are considering how they will educate their  children in the coming year. Whether you have been homeschooling a while or are  brand new to it, the AHEM website has everything you need to get started  homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
			  <p>The first step to start officially homeschooling is to  submit an education plan to your local school superintendent or school  committee. Traditionally, this has been done via a certified letter sent to  your local superintendents' office though many towns will now also accept  emailed plans (it doesn't hurt to send it both ways). If you are  withdrawing your child mid-year, you may also want to notify the school  that your child won't be returning.</p>
  <p>
			  It is important that all homeschooling parents know their rights and responsibilities.  We encourage everyone to educate themselves on the laws and what they do and  don't require. Our mission at AHEM is to provide you with the resources to  empower yourself. A great place to start is to review the following pages:</p>
            <ul class="nested">
              <li><a href="hs_guidelines.html">Homeschool Guidelines at a Glance</a></li>
              <li><a href="tips.html">Tips for Writing Your Education Plan</a></li>

              <li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a></li>
            </ul>
<p>Also, remember, kindergarten is not mandatory in Massachusetts. <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr8.html?section=all" target="_blank">Compulsory attendance</a> is in effect from ages 6  – 16. You only need to submit a plan for Fall 2023 if your child has turned or will  turn 6 in 2023.</p>

<h2>Field Trip Survey Results, Part 2:
  Science &amp; Nature
</h2>
	<p>Last time, we shared your field trip recommendations for museums and historical sites. You also gave us so many great suggestions for science and nature based field trips that we thought they deserved their own list. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230518_field_trips.html">Read more ▸ </a> </p>			
				<h2>Field Trip Survey Results, Part 1:
Museums &amp; History
</h2>
	     <p>Recently we asked      for your field trip suggestions across New England. Many of you responded,      telling us your favorites and your hidden gems. Since we got so many good      responses, we will present the information in two sections. Today we begin      with museums, historical sites, and more. Stay tuned for everything science      and nature in a future edition.</p>
		            
		            <h3>How often do you go?</h3>
		            
		            <p>One of the biggest advantages of homeschooling is the freedom it gives to      explore new places, and to do so at off-peak hours. So how often are      homeschoolers in Massachusetts getting out there? We found that there is      really a range&mdash;80% of you are getting out there anywhere from once a week      to once a quarter. Some only manage a field trip a few times a year (15%)      but some diehards (5%) are getting out more than once a week!</p>
		            
		            <h3>Where do you go?</h3>
		            <p>
		            With history all around us, lots of natural beauty, and tons of culture,      there is no shortage of field trip options in New England. So where are you      going?</p>

         <p>It's that time of year. Many of us are finishing up one school  year and thinking about reporting for the next. Whether this is your first year  reporting or you are an experienced homeschooler, AHEM has answers to all  your evaluation questions.</p>
           
           <h3>What forms of  evaluation are acceptable?</h3>
           <p><em><a href="../../charles.html">CARE AND PROTECTION OF  CHARLES &amp; others</a></em>, 399 Mass. 324  (1987) says that school officials and parents should agree on a  method of evaluation that may include one of the following approaches:  standardized testing, periodic progress report, or dated work  samples. Other methods of assessment, if mutually agreed upon by parents  and school officials, are also allowed.</p>
           
           <h3>How often do I need to  send an evaluation? What is my town asks for a mid-year report?</h3>

							  <h2>Connecting with Others: Town Point People</h2>
				<p>Are you looking to  connect with others in your town? Would you like to meet more people and to  help local homeschoolers?</p>
			  <p>
				  AHEM's <a href="tpp.html">Town Point People (TPPs)</a> are local contacts who help homeschoolers  make connections and find resources and groups near them. We've got over 50 towns covered so far but with over 300 towns in Massachusetts there are a lot more out there and we need your help to make  sure all Massachusetts homeschoolers can be connected with someone local.
			  </p>
			    <p>If your town is <a href="tpp.html">listed</a>, <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?subject=Please%20connect%20me%20with%20my%20TPP&body=My%20town%3A%20" target="_blank">we can connect  you </a>with the TPP in your town.</p>
				  <p>If your town isn't listed, we are still looking for a local contact. <a href="tpp.html">Read here</a> if you would like to find out about being a TPP yourself.</p>
<h2>In Praise of Park Days</h2>
				<h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
			  <p>Park days have long been a staple of my family’s homeschooling life. With four kids, these informal, weekly gatherings have provided everyone (even mom) with an opportunity to make friends and socialize in a way that no co-op we found ever could. Park days were the one constant in our schedule from year to year. (My high school age daughter did the recorded version of Spanish 3 because the live class would have interfered with park day. One has to have priorities, you know.)</p> 
<p>Park days are a melting pot. Homeschooling in Massachusetts attracts a pretty diverse group of people, and the families at our local park day have come from all different backgrounds and perspectives. I have seen the same scene countless times -- kids of different genders and ages running around together. And not just running but playing organized games without any adult input. If you have doubts that homeschoolers can be properly “socialized,” this is the place to go to put those doubts to rest. In my experience, homeschooling kids are incredibly patient and accepting of others who are different in any way. They are used to being with kids who don’t fit the usual mold.</p> 
<p>If all that doesn’t convince you, how about this: park days are for parents too. You can post online all you want but nothing compares to getting together with other homeschooling parents for some actual mid-day adult conversation. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230420_park.html">Read more ▸</a></p> 
			 <h2>Maintaining Homeschool Freedom</h2>
		   <h3>What&rsquo;s at  stake?</h3>
           <p>Homeschooling is still  sometimes misunderstood by conventional educators, legislators, homeschoolers&rsquo;  friends and relatives, and the general public. Homeschooling is not school at  home. That is not why it works or what makes it valuable. The strength of  homeschooling is that it allows a diversity of families to teach theirchildren in the way  that is best for them, with the flexibility to meet children&rsquo;s changing needs.</p>
           <p>Would a&nbsp;statute serve us better than the current case law?  Why can’t all homeschoolers in Massachusetts participate in school activities?  Shouldn’t we get vouchers or tax credits to defray the cost of homeschooling?  Below, we consider whether these ideas would expand or diminish homeschooling  freedom. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230413_freedom.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

<h2>Help Getting Started Homeschooling</h2>
				<p>With the new year, we  see a number of people looking to make a change in their children's education.  It may be that you are considering homeschooling your own children or maybe you  have a friend that is starting to ask about the process. Either  way, the AHEM website has everything one needs to get started  homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The first step to  start officially homeschooling is to submit an education plan to your  local school superintendent or school committee. Traditionally, this has been  done via a certified letter sent to your local superintendent&rsquo;s office though  many towns will now also accept emailed plans (it doesn't hurt to send it both  ways). Either way, be sure to get a receipt. If you are withdrawing your child mid-year, you may also want to  notify the school that your child won&rsquo;t be returning.</p>
				<p>Also, remember, kindergarten is not mandatory in Massachusetts. Compulsory attendance is in effect from ages 6 – 16. You only need to submit a plan for the 2022-2023 school year if your child turned 6 in 2022. You would submit an education plan for the 2023-2024 school year if your child turns 6 in 2023. <a href="getting_started.html">Read more &#x25B8;</a></p>

			  <h2>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h2>
<p>This time of year we begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are being asked for a midyear report. </p> 
				<h4>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable form of evaluation.</h4>
<p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others,</em></a> 399 Mass. 324 (1987) clearly outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility. <a href="progress_reports.html">Read more &#x25B8;</a></p>
