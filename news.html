				<h2>Homeschooling for College-Prep - Part 2</h2>
		   <h3>Earning Credit Early</h3>
<h4>by Erin Cyr</h4>
		   <p><em>In <a href="20250605_col_prep.html">Part 1</a>, Erin looked at your role as the guidance counselor as your child prepares for college. This time, they share with us how their child earned college credit early to save money in the long run. </em></p>
		   <p>Lots of homeschooling families have one breadwinning parent or one who works full-time while the other works part-time. We need to save on college wherever we can! For my homeschooler, the goal has been to get an excellent education through college without getting stuck with insurmountable debt after graduation. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250619_col_prep_2.html">Read more . . .</a></p>

			<h2>Homeschooling for College-Prep - Part 1</h2>
<h4>by Erin Cyr</h4>

<h3>What Colleges Expect</h3>
<p>First off, college is not for everyone, and for some folks, right after high school might not be the best time to go to college. I started college right after high school, but it wasn't the right time for me, and I eventually graduated at 28 years old. That being said, I have been homeschooling a kid who would very much like to go to college. In fact, it has been her driving force for the last few years, and it’s been fun to be along for the ride.</p>
<h4>Record-keeping</h4>
<p>For me, the key to not feeling overwhelmed has been good record-keeping. There are lots of homeschooling styles available to us, which is awesome. If you think your kid might want to go to college, it’s good practice to keep track of what your kids are up to in terms of learning and activities, no matter what type of homeschooling you do. That might mean keeping track of classes and grades for you, and/or slowly building a record of activities, volunteering, sports, etc. You want to document what you’re doing at the time instead of looking back over four years and guessing at how many hours they spent doing each thing, or what they got on that final in biology two years ago. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250605_col_prep.html">Read more...</a></p>
				<h2>Survey Results: Forms, Documentation, and Registration</h2>
	<p>We set up the survey to collect empirical data about:</p>
	   <ul class="nested">
	   <li>the use of online forms to submit education plans</li>
       <li>the request for documentation beyond an education plan</li>
       <li>the request to register a homeschooled student</li>
	   </ul>
    <p>We had responses from 285 homeschoolers in 50% of towns in Massachusetts. Thanks to all who took time out of their day to fill out the survey. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250529_form_survey_results.html">Read more ...</a></p>
				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: End-of-Year Evaluations</h2>
         <p>It's that time of year. Many of us are finishing up one school  year and thinking about reporting for the next. Whether this is your first year  reporting or you are an experienced homeschooler, AHEM has answers to all your evaluation questions. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230511_eval_faq.html">Read more...</a></p>

<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Sajjona's Story</h2>
		     <img src="images/murphy_cropped.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>by Heidi Murphy</h4>
 
<h3>Meeting Sajjona</h3>
<p>Parenting does not come with a manual. Everything parents experience is a learning process with their child. There will be bumps along the way. Yet, the child grows and develops, and as a parent one enjoys every moment and every adventure. However, having a child with unique needs and a life-threatening illness has parents navigating like a private investigator. Being heartbroken and loving your child at the same time is like being on a roller coaster ride of emotions. We were told our child had been born with a rare medical condition called Trisomy 18. She was deemed “incompatible with life.” We were told by the geneticist, “She will live two weeks if you are lucky.” We relied heavily upon our faith in God. This trust in Him got us through our darkest days. Weeks turned into months and months turned into years. Sajjona Murphy is now seven-and-a-half years old and not just surviving—she is thriving. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250508_murphy.html">Read more. . .</a></p>

			  <h2>In Praise of Park Days</h2>
              <img src="images/park_day.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>By Roberta Van          Vlack</h4>
	                            <p>Park          days have long been a staple of my family’s homeschooling life. With          four kids, these informal, weekly gatherings have provided everyone          (even mom) with an opportunity to make friends and socialize in a way          that no co-op we found ever could. Park days were the one constant in          our schedule from year to year. (My high school age daughter did the          recorded version of Spanish 3 because the live class would have          interfered with park day. One has to have priorities, you know.) <a href="news-archives/2025/20250501_park.html">Read more ...</a></p>
			  <h2>The Socialization Question</h2> 
		   <h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I’d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one’s  ability to be relational—to form,   build, and negotiate relationships. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220811_sword.html">Read more...</a></p>
				<h2 id="web">Volunteer Opportunity: Webmaster</h2>
			  <p>Did you know that AHEM is entirely volunteer-run? We are a small team of homeschoolers and former homeschoolers who work hard to stay on top of the homeschooling landscape in Massachusetts and to communicate the information to you. Our website is a big part of our mission. It is often the first place prospective homeschoolers go to find out what is required. It is our connection to the world.</p> 
<p>Sadly for us, one of our former board members, a long-time homeschooler and passionate homeschool advocate is retiring. We are looking for a replacement to take over just one of her many responsibilities, that of maintaining our website. If you think that this is something that you could help with, please fill out our <a href="vol_app.html">volunteer application</a>. Ideally, what we are looking for is:</p>
				<ul class="nested">
<li>Some experience with website maintenance. Currently we are using Dreamweaver and Github so familiarity with these platforms is a plus.</li>  
<li>A few hours a month available. Most updates are done weekly. Being able to attend an occasional (virtual) board meeting to check-in some months is also a plus.</li>
<li>A commitment to homeschooling. Ideally we would like to have a current or former homeschooling parent.</li>
<li>A minimum one year commitment. Because every transition takes time, we would like to get someone who can commit to working with AHEM for at least a year.</li>
			  </ul>
<p>If you think that this is something you could do, please reach out to us using our <a href="vol_app.html">volunteer application</a>. If being a webmaster is not within your skill set but you would like to help with AHEM's mission in another way, you can also use that application. We are always looking for <a href="tpp.html">Town Point People</a>, <a href="meet_ma_hsers.html">those to write articles</a>, help with mailings, work on graphic design projects, help monitor legislation, and more. AHEM only works because you do!</p>
			
				<h2>Quiz: Is It Overreach?</h2>
		   <p>How well do you know Massachusetts homeschooling regulations? Take our quiz: “<a href="news-archives/2025/20250327_quiz.html">Is it Overreach?</a>” to find out.</p>
				<h2>Independent Homeschooling</h2>
		   <h3>Defining AHEM’s Mission in a Changing Landscape</h3>
	     <p>AHEM believes that informed and active homeschoolers        are their own best advocates in maintaining the right to independently        homeschool. “Independent” does not mean doing it alone. Homeschoolers        have long used the resources of their community to augment their experiences.        Co-ops, groups of families who come together and share in educating their        children, have also been a part of homeschooling for a long time. <a href="independent_hs.html">Read more...</a></p>

				
			 <h2>Protecting Independent Homeschooling: A New Webpage from AHEM</h2>
		<p>Since 2003, <a href="about.html">our mission </a>at AHEM has been to  advocate for independent homeschooling across the Commonwealth. We are  happy to say that, while we are by no means the least regulated state,  homeschool reporting remains relatively easy for most and there have been no  significant changes in the law for quite some time. We are aware, however, that  there are always changes in the homeschool landscape and that this may cause  concern for some. With that in mind, we have revamped our website to include a page specifically  devoted to homeschool advocacy and our mission to preserve the freedom we  currently enjoy. On the page “<a href="best-advocate.html">Protecting Independent Homeschooling,</a>” you can find articles about  homeschool advocacy, issues of concern, and stories of homeschoolers who have  advocated for their rights. In the coming months, we will be adding to this  page, discussing questions like: “What is ‘independent homeschooling’?” and “What  about homeschool funding?” <a href="news-archives/2025/20250306_protecting.html">Read more...</a></p>
		
			  <h2>Connecting with Others: Town Point People</h2>
			  <p><em>Would you like to help  connect homeschooling families in your town or area? Are you wondering who is  new in your area, or how you can support new families?</em> </p>
			  <p>AHEM keeps a list of local, independent volunteers known as Town Point People (TPPs). The purpose of TPPs is social. TPPs are there to help  homeschoolers make local connections and find resources and groups near them. There are more than 300 towns in Massachusetts. So far we've got about a tenth of those covered so there are lots more out there and we need your help to make sure all homeschoolers in MA can be connected with someone local.</p>
				  <p>If your town is  listed <a href="tpp.html">here</a>, <a href="one-on-one.html">get in touch</a> and we can connect you to the TPP in your town.</p>
				  <p>If your town isn't  listed yet, that means we are still looking for a local contact. <a href="tpp.html">Read more here</a> if you would like to find out  more about being a TPP yourself.</p>
<p>In either case, you must be  an active <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">subscriber</a> to AHEM emails.</p>
<h2 id="forms">Forms, Documentation, and Registration</h2>
				<p> 	Are towns asking for more documentation than they used to? How many towns request forms or applications? Your answers help us know what is happening across the state and if homeschoolers are really being asked for more or not. If you reported as a homeschoolers in Massachusetts for this current school year, please take a few minutes to fill out our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5QWK836" target="_blank">Forms, Documentation, and Registration survey</a>. Even if you had no issues in your town, your answers are important. Every response helps us track trends. Thank you!</p>
			 <h2>Yum: A Bite-Sized and Nourishing Homeschooling Strategy for All Ages</h2>
		   <h4>by Sophia Sayigh</h4>
		   <p><em>The following is a slightly edited version of an article which we first offered in 2020. Though the world is no longer on lock-down, a cold and dreary February can make any homeschool family a little stir-crazy. We hope that this will inspire anyone who needs to change things up a little this time of year. </em></p>
           <img src="images/daydreaming.JPG" alt=""/>
<p>Are you struggling with the kids home full-time? Maybe you feel a little trapped a claustrophobic as sleety winter storms seem to roll in day after day. For anyone needing a change and a chance to recharge, I  offer this strategy to reset life at home. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250213_yum.html">Read more...</a></p>

			  <h2 id="foreign">Introducing Foreign Language Resources</h2>
				<p>Occasionally AHEM gets requests for resources in other languages. To meet this need, we have created a version of our FAQ in <a href="faq_spanish.html">Spanish</a>, <a href="faq_portuguese.html">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, and <a href="faq_french.html">French</a> (with hopefully more languages to come)! You can find these resources&nbsp; linked from the sidebar on our main <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a> .</p>
<p>If you are proficient in another language and would like to help us get this information into even more languages, please fill out our <a href="vol_app.html">volunteer form</a>.</p>
				<h2 id="libsurv">Homeschoolers and Library Usage</h2>
				<p>We love libraries and we hope you do too. We'd love to hear how you use your local library and what programming you'd like to see. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G8ZC8VP" target="_blank">Fill out the survey here.</a>&nbsp; The results of this survey will be shared with Massachusetts librarians via our <a href="libraries.html">new librarian page</a> and our newsletter just for librarians. Thanks for participating!</p>
				<h2>Annual Homeschooling Policy and Practice Survey Results</h2>
   	          <p>Every year, AHEM sends out a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">survey</a> asking homeschoolers across the state about their town’s homeschooling policies and about their interactions with school officials.</p>
	                <p>We use this information in two ways. As we answer questions through our <a href="one-on-one.html">One-on-One Contacts</a> program, we refer to the database to see the experiences of other homeschoolers in a given town. The responses also give us a snapshot of homeschooling policy and practice trends over time so we can see if there are broad changes that are occurring across the state.</p>
	                <p>Below are some of the results from this year's questionnaire.</p>
              <h3>Regarding face-to-face meetings</h3>
			  <img src="images/202501_meetings.png" alt=""/>
<p>In the last year, 95.33% of respondents reported that school officials do not ask for face-to-face meetings. Of those asked to meet, 30.77% choose to comply. Usually declining a meeting is as simple as saying “No, thank you,” or even ignoring the request. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250116_pandp_survey_results.html">Read more...</a></p>
