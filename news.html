			<h2>The Year in Review 2024</h2>
                <p>As another year draws to a close, we at AHEM find ourselves grateful for the opportunity to walk with our own children through these formative years; for having additional time to listen and reflect on life; to learn and grow as families and a homeschooling community. AHEM is driven by the goal of supporting your family to nurture, learn with and support your children during these special years. It is a privilege to walk this path with you and we are grateful for your engagement with us!</p>
				<p>Your support is crucial in helping us continue our mission of empowering individuals and fostering connections within our community. Join us in making a difference—every contribution counts!</p>
				   <h3><a href="support.html">Please consider AHEM when you are making charitable donations!</a></h3>

			  <h2>Why and How to Get Connected</h2>
              <h4>by Sophia Sayigh</h4>
                  <p><em><q>It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself…</q> - Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>

              <p>In this day and age, homeschoolers represent a market. There are many          businesses catering to homeschoolers&rsquo; needs—or perceived needs. When      first starting out it can be especially tempting to sign up for a          multitude of classes or experiences rather than putting your energy          into a grassroots network such as a local homeschool support group.          Before you know it, your days are filled with activity and you don&rsquo;t          look back.</p>
	                    <p>The intangibles you’d be missing out on—real connection with other homeschoolers and personal empowerment—might be some of the best kept secrets of homeschooling, as well as what would sustain you on this path in the end. It’s worth putting some time and effort in, and yes, if shy, getting your courage up, to figure out how to insinuate     yourself into a group of homeschoolers, rather than filling your day     with activities that leave you with a busy day void of meaningful          relationships. <a href="news-archives/2021/20211021_why_and_how.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Books: Gift Ideas for Homeschoolers and Potential Homeschoolers
</h2>
	<p>Since it is the time of year for the giving and receiving of gifts, we thought it  might be appropriate to reshare this list of some favorite book suggestions. Many of these books were recommended by you, our readers, in a  survey we sent out in the spring. Others come from our list of personal favorites. Whether you are looking for yourself or need ideas for that friend or family member who has shown an interest in homeschooling, we think you'll find some great ideas: <a href="news-archives/2024/20241212_gift_books.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Conform to Forms?</h2>
                  <p>One  of the most frequent questions AHEM gets is about forms or applications. Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, not by statute, there is a lot that is either not clearly laid out or that is open to interpretation. The following attempts to unravel one of the murkier areas. We encourage all homeschoolers to read <a href="ma_hs_law.html">the court decisions</a> for themselves. </p>
				<p>Although it is not required to fill out a school-generated form to homeschool in Massachusetts, some school officials find that forms make their lives easier, and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				
			    <h2>The Art of Motherhood: Taking Care of Ourselves (To Remind Myself)</h2>
              <h4>By Erin Matica</h4>
                        <p>When we are pregnant and while our children are very young, our focus and energy seem to be only about them. That is how it should be. All mammal species, most birds, and even some reptiles, fish, and insects take exquisite care of their young. The robins nesting in our barn eaves seem to have boundless energy brooding, feeding, protecting, nest cleaning, etc. The chicks grow fast and fledge within weeks, but during that nestling stage the parents are working non-stop. Many will continue to feed and look after their young even after they've fledged. <a href="news-archives/2021/20211111_art_of_motherhood.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
