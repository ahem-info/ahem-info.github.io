			 <h2>Protecting Independent Homeschooling: A New Webpage from AHEM</h2>
		<p>Since 2003, <a href="about.html">our mission </a>at AHEM has been to  advocate for independent homeschooling across the Commonwealth. We are  happy to say that, while we are by no means the least regulated state,  homeschool reporting remains relatively easy for most and there have been no  significant changes in the law for quite some time. We are aware, however, that  there are always changes in the homeschool landscape and that this may cause  concern for some. With that in mind, we have revamped our website to include a page specifically  devoted to homeschool advocacy and our mission to preserve the freedom we  currently enjoy. On the page “<a href="best-advocate.html">Protecting Independent Homeschooling,</a>” you can find articles about  homeschool advocacy, issues of concern, and stories of homeschoolers who have  advocated for their rights. In the coming months, we will be adding to this  page, discussing questions like: “What is ‘independent homeschooling’?” and “What  about homeschool funding?” <a href="news-archives/2025/20250306_protecting.html">Read more...</a></p>
		
			  <h2>Connecting with Others: Town Point People</h2>
			  <p><em>Would you like to help  connect homeschooling families in your town or area? Are you wondering who is  new in your area, or how you can support new families?</em> </p>
			  <p>AHEM keeps a list of local, independent volunteers known as Town Point People (TPPs). The purpose of TPPs is social. TPPs are there to help  homeschoolers make local connections and find resources and groups near them. There are more than 300 towns in Massachusetts. So far we've got about a tenth of those covered so there are lots more out there and we need your help to make sure all homeschoolers in MA can be connected with someone local.</p>
				  <p>If your town is  listed <a href="tpp.html">here</a>, <a href="one-on-one.html">get in touch</a> and we can connect you to the TPP in your town.</p>
				  <p>If your town isn't  listed yet, that means we are still looking for a local contact. <a href="tpp.html">Read more here</a> if you would like to find out  more about being a TPP yourself.</p>
<p>In either case, you must be  an active <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">subscriber</a> to AHEM emails.</p>
<h2 id="forms">Forms, Documentation, and Registration</h2>
				<p> 	Are towns asking for more documentation than they used to? How many towns request forms or applications? Your answers help us know what is happening across the state and if homeschoolers are really being asked for more or not. If you reported as a homeschoolers in Massachusetts for this current school year, please take a few minutes to fill out our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5QWK836" target="_blank">Forms, Documentation, and Registration survey</a>. Even if you had no issues in your town, your answers are important. Every response helps us track trends. Thank you!</p>
			 <h2>Yum: A Bite-Sized and Nourishing Homeschooling Strategy for All Ages</h2>
		   <h4>by Sophia Sayigh</h4>
		   <p><em>The following is a slightly edited version of an article which we first offered in 2020. Though the world is no longer on lock-down, a cold and dreary February can make any homeschool family a little stir-crazy. We hope that this will inspire anyone who needs to change things up a little this time of year. </em></p>

<p>Are you struggling with the kids home full-time? Maybe you feel a little trapped a claustrophobic as sleety winter storms seem to roll in day after day. For anyone needing a change and a chance to recharge, I  offer this strategy to reset life at home. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250213_yum.html">Read more...</a></p>

			  <h2 id="foreign">Introducing Foreign Language Resources</h2>
				<p>Occasionally AHEM gets requests for resources in other languages. To meet this need, we have created a version of our FAQ in <a href="faq_spanish.html">Spanish</a>, <a href="faq_portuguese.html">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, and <a href="faq_french.html">French</a> (with hopefully more languages to come)! You can find these resources&nbsp; linked from the sidebar on our main <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a> .</p>
<p>If you are proficient in another language and would like to help us get this information into even more languages, please fill out our <a href="vol_app.html">volunteer form</a>.</p>
				<h2 id="libsurv">Homeschoolers and Library Usage</h2>
				<p>We love libraries and we hope you do too. We'd love to hear how you use your local library and what programming you'd like to see. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/G8ZC8VP" target="_blank">Fill out the survey here.</a>&nbsp; The results of this survey will be shared with Massachusetts librarians via our <a href="libraries.html">new librarian page</a> and our newsletter just for librarians. Thanks for participating!</p>
				<h2>Annual Homeschooling Policy and Practice Survey Results</h2>
   	          <p>Every year, AHEM sends out a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">survey</a> asking homeschoolers across the state about their town’s homeschooling policies and about their interactions with school officials.</p>
	                <p>We use this information in two ways. As we answer questions through our <a href="one-on-one.html">One-on-One Contacts</a> program, we refer to the database to see the experiences of other homeschoolers in a given town. The responses also give us a snapshot of homeschooling policy and practice trends over time so we can see if there are broad changes that are occurring across the state.</p>
	                <p>Below are some of the results from this year's questionnaire.</p>
              <h3>Regarding face-to-face meetings</h3>
			  <img src="images/202501_meetings.png" alt=""/>
<p>In the last year, 95.33% of respondents reported that school officials do not ask for face-to-face meetings. Of those asked to meet, 30.77% choose to comply. Usually declining a meeting is as simple as saying “No, thank you,” or even ignoring the request. <a href="news-archives/2025/20250116_pandp_survey_results.html">Read more...</a></p>
