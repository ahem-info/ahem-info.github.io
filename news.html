				<h2>AHEM&rsquo;s Policy and Practice Data Analysis - July 2019</h2>
       <p>Posted: July 11, 2019</p>
				<p>For over fifteen  years, AHEM has been <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HSGC3N2">collecting information from homeschoolers</a> about official  town policy (including the policies themselves), and about how interfacing with  school officials works in practice in towns in Massachusetts, according to  homeschoolers. <a href="policy_and_practice_analysis_2019.html">Read more.</a></p>
			  <h2>Back by popular demand: Sample Progress Report</h2>
              <p>Posted: June 27, 2019</p>
              <p>You asked, we listened. Here's a <a href="sample_progress_report.html">sample progress report</a> that  has been accepted in Massachusetts. <a href="sample_progress_report.html">Read more.</a></p>
              <h2>Evaluating Evaluation: Progress Reports</h2>
			  <p>Posted: June 13, 2019</p>
			  <p>In Massachusetts,  homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for  evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html">CARE  AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399 Mass. 324 (1987)</a> clearly  outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of  the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as  periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the  parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to  fulfill their responsibility. <a href="progress_reports.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>Announcing  AHEM Networking Forum</h2>
				<p>Posted: May 23, 2019</p>
<p>AHEM  listened and heard the challenges independent family-based homeschooling  families face these days. Elists have fizzled, Facebook is an unreliable source  for finding out about events, many groups seem splintered or private. Where do  you fit in? Is it worth going to the park if you’re not sure anyone else will  show up? How can you meet other homeschoolers who live nearby? You are not  alone. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190523_forum.html">Read more. </a></p>
<h2>Outreach!</h2>
				<p>Posted: May 2, 2019</p>
				<p>Remember when you were considering homeschooling but you weren’t sure where to find information about it? AHEM’s <a href="../../documents/considering_homeschooling.pdf"><em>Considering Homeschooling</em> brochure</a> cuts to the chase with information on deciding to homeschool and getting started homeschooling in Massachusetts. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190502_pamphlet_outreach.html">Read more.</a></p>
			  
<h2>POPCORN AND PAGE TURNERS: RUNNING A TEEN BOOK GROUP</h2>
			  <p>Posted: April 11, 2019</p>
			  <img src="images/bookgroupbooks.jpg" alt=""/>
			  <p>When my son, Fred, was 13, we decided to start a book group to read adult literature. I had never led a book group before—just had read a lot as a fiction lover—but was excited to give it a try.

<h2>Are Homeschoolers Entitled to Participate in  Public School Classes and Activities?</h2>
				<p>Posted April 11, 2019</p>
			  <p>At some point in  their homeschooling experience, for varied and personal reasons, families may  seek out classes, extracurricular activities, or athletic programs offered by  their local school district. One might assume that a homeschooling family paying property taxes in their  town would be entitled to gain full access to public school offerings, but it’s  not quite that simple. <a href="public_school_participation.html">Read more.</a></p>
			    <h2>Bespoke Homeschooling Without Breaking the Bank</h2>
					<p>Posted February 21, 2019</p>
					<p>You’ve made the leap, cut the cord, taken the plunge&mdash;however you put it&mdash;you’ve pulled your kid out of school, or made the decision not to send them at all. Often this decision means the family budget also takes a hit, as one or both parents adjust their schedules and/or work hours to spend more time with the children. It could even mean one parent leaving the workforce for a time. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190221_bespoke.html">Read more.</a></p>
			<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
				<p>Posted February 7, 2019</p>
				<p>The Massachusetts Legislature began its 191st session on January 2, 2019. The various bills that AHEM tracked in the 190th session, regarding changes to the compulsory attendance age and other educational issues, have either died or been set aside for further study in the new session. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190207_leg_update.html">Read more. </a></p>
			<h2>Unschooling as a Feminist Act</h2>
			  <p>Posted January 3, 2019</p>
				<p>When I was a young mother, I wore a t-shirt with the words: “The hand that rocks the cradle rocks the boat.” The phrase put a spin on a 19th century poem entitled “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Rules the World” by American poet William Ross Wallace. I understood at the time that becoming a mother was increasing my desire to create change in the world, although I didn’t know where that would lead me. I had already realized that, as the feminist movement espoused, the personal is political. I had already challenged a few assumptions about how life was supposed to work&mdash;including rejecting both the style in which I’d been parenting and the institution of school as an effective vehicle for education. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190103_unschool-feminist.html">Read more.</a></p>
