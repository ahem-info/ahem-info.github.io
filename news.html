				<h2>Your Best Homeschooling Memories</h2>
           <h3>Inspiration from Your Fellow Homeschoolers</h3>
           <p>Last month we asked you to share with us your best  homeschooling memories  -- field trips,  books, projects, and just snapshots from daily life. So many of you responded  that it is going to take us at least two newsletters-worth to share all your  wonderful responses. A big thank you to all who contributed. We at AHEM were  inspired and we hope that you will be too. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Endless days at the pool and our favorite parks&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;My favorite memory of homeschooling my son is a field trip  to a local park for a science lesson! He loved being outside and in nature for  school!&rdquo;<br>
           – Andrea from Gardner</p>
         <p>&ldquo;When my in-laws, who are public school and were suspicious  of homeschooling, told me I was doing an amazing job, and bragged to others  about it.&rdquo;<br>

				<h2>Reading the Massachusetts Homeschool Laws</h2>
		   
	     <p>At  AHEM, our mission is to empower you as the homeschooling parent. While we  are always happy to talk through issues you may be facing, our goal is to give  you the tools you need to advocate for yourself. The AHEM website is chock full of resources to  help you do just that.</p>
           <p>
As you educate your children, we encourage you to also educate yourself.  Reading through case law may not be something you have ever done before and the  task may seem daunting. We are here to help. In this short piece we talk about  who should read the laws and why, what they consist of, and how to read  them. <a href="news-archives/2023/20230309_reading_law.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

<h2>Help Getting Started Homeschooling</h2>
				<p>With the new year, we  see a number of people looking to make a change in their children's education.  It may be that you are considering homeschooling your own children or maybe you  have a friend that is starting to ask about the process. Either  way, the AHEM website has everything one needs to get started  homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The first step to  start officially homeschooling is to submit an education plan to your  local school superintendent or school committee. Traditionally, this has been  done via a certified letter sent to your local superintendent&rsquo;s office though  many towns will now also accept emailed plans (it doesn't hurt to send it both  ways). Either way, be sure to get a receipt. If you are withdrawing your child mid-year, you may also want to  notify the school that your child won&rsquo;t be returning.</p>
				<p>Also, remember, kindergarten is not mandatory in Massachusetts. Compulsory attendance is in effect from ages 6 – 16. You only need to submit a plan for the 2022-2023 school year if your child turned 6 in 2022. You would submit an education plan for the 2023-2024 school year if your child turns 6 in 2023. <a href="getting_started.html">Read more &#x25B8;</a></p>

			  <h2>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h2>
<p>This time of year we begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are being asked for a midyear report. </p> 
				<h4>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable form of evaluation.</h4>
<p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others,</em></a> 399 Mass. 324 (1987) clearly outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility. <a href="progress_reports.html">Read more &#x25B8;</a></p>
