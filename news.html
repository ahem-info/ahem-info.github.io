<h2>AHEM GOES TO THE MASC/MASS JOINT CONFERENCE</h2>
				<p>Posted: November 14, 2019</p>
<p>his year AHEM tabled at the Massachusetts Association of School Committees (MASC) and Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents (MASS) joint conference, where school committee members network with peers and learn from sessions and exhibitors.

In addition to storing school policies on their website, they provide sample policies to school committees. <a href="news-archives/2019/20191114_masc_conference.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>THE VALUE OF HOMESCHOOLING</h2>
			  <p>Posted: November 7, 2019</p>
<p>We live in a culture that often doesn’t value what matters most. How many times have I been to a party and when people ask what I <q>do</q> they are less than impressed with the answer when I say <q>I’m a homeschooling mother</q>? <a href="news-archives/2019/20191107_value.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2>AHEM Named <q>2019 Top-Rated Nonprofit</q></h2>
			  <h3>Award based on Outstanding Online Reviews</h3>
				<p>Posted: October 31, 2019</p>
         	<p>AHEM has been honored with a Top-Rated Awards of 2019 from GreatNonprofits! <a href="https://greatnonprofits.org/org/advocates-for-home-education-in-massachusetts-inc" target="_blank">We appreciate all of your contributions! </a><a href="news-archives/2019/20191031_toprated_nonprofit.html"> Read more.</a></p>
         	<h2 id="forum">AHEM Networking Forum</h2>
				<p>Posted: October 24, 2019</p>
			  <p>Let's make stuff happen. <a href="forum.html">Join!</a></p>
				<p>AHEM listened and heard the challenges independent  family-based homeschooling families face these days. Elists have fizzled,  Facebook is an unreliable source for finding out about events, many groups seem  splintered or private. Where do you fit in? Is it worth going to the park if  you’re not sure anyone else will show up? How can you meet other homeschoolers  who live nearby? You are not alone. This is a refrain we have heard a lot in  our talks with Massachusetts homeschoolers. In an attempt to harness the power  of technology in service of connection, the AHEM Networking Forum and Calendar  were created to facilitate families in different parts of Massachusetts to meet  in person repeatedly and get to know each other. To read more about how it  works, and to potentially join, <a href="forum.html">go take a look!</a></p>

				<h2><q>How to Help Your Child Succeed at School</q></h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/help-your-child-succeed-at-school" target="_blank">title</a> in the Smarter Living section of <em>The New York Times</em> caught my eye.

              <h2>Evaluating Evaluation: Progress Reports</h2>
			  <p>Posted: June 13, 2019</p>
			  <p>In Massachusetts,  homeschooling parents, as the teachers of their children, are responsible for  evaluating their progress. <a href="charles.html">CARE  AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399 Mass. 324 (1987)</a> clearly  outlines three forms of evaluation: “Other means of evaluating the progress of  the children may be substituted for the formal testing process, such as  periodic progress reports or dated work samples, subject to the approval of the  parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340) Parents may choose one of them to  fulfill their responsibility. <a href="progress_reports.html">Read more.</a></p>

				<h2>Announcing  AHEM Networking Forum</h2>
				<p>Posted: May 23, 2019</p>

<h2>POPCORN AND PAGE TURNERS: RUNNING A TEEN BOOK GROUP</h2>
			  <p>Posted: April 11, 2019</p>
			  <img src="images/bookgroupbooks.jpg" alt=""/>
			  <p>When my son, Fred, was 13, we decided to start a book group to read adult literature. I had never led a book group before—just had read a lot as a fiction lover—but was excited to give it a try.

<h2>Are Homeschoolers Entitled to Participate in  Public School Classes and Activities?</h2>
				<p>Posted April 11, 2019</p>
			  <p>At some point in  their homeschooling experience, for varied and personal reasons, families may  seek out classes, extracurricular activities, or athletic programs offered by  their local school district. One might assume that a homeschooling family paying property taxes in their  town would be entitled to gain full access to public school offerings, but it’s  not quite that simple. <a href="public_school_participation.html">Read more.</a></p>
			    <h2>Bespoke Homeschooling Without Breaking the Bank</h2>
					<p>Posted February 21, 2019</p>
					<p>You’ve made the leap, cut the cord, taken the plunge&mdash;however you put it&mdash;you’ve pulled your kid out of school, or made the decision not to send them at all. Often this decision means the family budget also takes a hit, as one or both parents adjust their schedules and/or work hours to spend more time with the children. It could even mean one parent leaving the workforce for a time. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190221_bespoke.html">Read more.</a></p>
			<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
				<p>Posted February 7, 2019</p>
				<p>The Massachusetts Legislature began its 191st session on January 2, 2019. The various bills that AHEM tracked in the 190th session, regarding changes to the compulsory attendance age and other educational issues, have either died or been set aside for further study in the new session. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190207_leg_update.html">Read more. </a></p>
			<h2>Unschooling as a Feminist Act</h2>
			  <p>Posted January 3, 2019</p>
				<p>When I was a young mother, I wore a t-shirt with the words: “The hand that rocks the cradle rocks the boat.” The phrase put a spin on a 19th century poem entitled “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Rules the World” by American poet William Ross Wallace. I understood at the time that becoming a mother was increasing my desire to create change in the world, although I didn’t know where that would lead me. I had already realized that, as the feminist movement espoused, the personal is political. I had already challenged a few assumptions about how life was supposed to work&mdash;including rejecting both the style in which I’d been parenting and the institution of school as an effective vehicle for education. <a href="news-archives/2019/20190103_unschool-feminist.html">Read more.</a></p>
