                             <p>
                             When I toured the high school that I          would be attending from ninth to twelfth grade, I admit that I was feeling a          little nervous. It was an anxious feeling that was a lot          bigger than when I was moving from elementary to          middle school. However, something else didn’t feel          right. When the school tour was over, I began getting a          tickly feeling in my throat. When I was born, I had to have a          trach put in to help me breathe better. I’ve had it forever,          so we have to take extra good care of it by cleaning and suctioning it          to keep me healthy. As it turns out, the high school was an          old building. The air quality would not be good for my          trach, so Mom, Dad, and I got together to think about what we should          do. Mom, who’s always concerned about what happens to my trach was          terrified of sending me to a school that was unhealthy for me, and I          was nervous about getting suctioned every single day throughout the          school year. It’s safe to say we were both on the same page, so what          could we do instead? Eventually, with a little bit of          research, Mom suggested that we try homeschooling. It was a          big risk, but it was the only alternative we could think of. I never          knew how much fun I’d have throughout those four years. This is          the story of my experience as a homeschooler. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220303_wachta.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

				<h2>AHEM Needs You!</h2>
		   <h3>Your skills,  expertise, and helping hands!</h3>
           <p>AHEM is “staffed” by a small handful of currently homeschooling  or formerly homeschooling parent volunteers.&nbsp;To stay viable, we need young  families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent homeschooling  as an educational option to step up and help out if Massachusetts homeschoolers  are&nbsp;to keep the right to homeschool the way they want to homeschool. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220217_volunteers.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>Meet          Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Young People's Society of Storywriters</h2>
            <img src="images/amazon/Unlocked.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>By Isabella Watkins</h4>
		   <p>Homeschooling          is ideal for the writing process. It not only gives you time to work on          your craft, it also gives you the freedom to work with whomever you want.          Writing with a group of friends who feel like family has helped my          writing improve, and sharing my writing with supportive people has          heightened my confidence in my work. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220210_unlocked.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

			  <h2>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h2>
                   <p>This time of year we      begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already      worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are      being asked for a midyear report. The following is a revised version of <a href="progress_reports.html">our article on progress reports.</a></p> 
		      <h4>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable      form of evaluation.</h4>
                   <p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of      their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <em><a href="charles.html">CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399      Mass. 324 (1987)</a></em> clearly outlines three forms of evaluation:      “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted      for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated      work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340)      Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220127_your_progress_report.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
