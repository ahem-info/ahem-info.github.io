              <p>AHEM          is <q>staffed</q> by a small handful of currently homeschooling or formerly          homeschooling parent volunteers. To stay viable, we need young          families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent          homeschooling as an educational option to step up and help out if          Massachusetts homeschoolers are to keep the right to homeschool          the way they want to homeschool.</p>

<p>Reissuing this piece from almost a year ago. Hoping it can act as a bit of a pressure valve, especially during these long winter days when homeschool burnout tends to rear its head.</p>
<h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
         <p>Maybe you have subscribed to our list or are visiting our  website because you have unexpectedly found yourself at home all day with your  kids. You may have seen some blog posts and articles with suggestions for how  to manage having kids around all day. I know I have. Some pressure parents to  impose school-like schedules on kids so that kids won&rsquo;t <q>fall behind.</q> Here I  have tried to draw on the wisdom of practicing homeschoolers in these difficult  times. Trying to recreate school at home can be stressful. And goodness knows,  none of us need more stress in our lives right now. So here is a short list of  tips for being around your kids 24/7 that have been successful strategies for  many a homeschooling family: <a href="news-archives/2020/20200316_covid_19.html">Read more.</a></p>		   
			  <h2>A Brief History of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</h2>
		   <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		   <p>Massachusetts has no statute that specifically addresses homeschooling. Rather, homeschooling is governed by case law, in conjunction with applicable statutes. The most important case is <em><a href="charles.html">Care and Protection of Charles &amp; others</a></em>, 399 Mass. 324 (1987). In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the compulsory attendance statute, General Laws Chapter 76, Section 1. In its decision, the Court was aware of the need to balance two basic tenets—the constitutional right of the parents to homeschool and the state’s interest in the education of its citizenry. The result was delegation of homeschooling oversight to local school districts. <a href="history.html">Read more.</a></p>
				<h2 id="nuts">Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</h2>
			  <p><strong>Thursday,  February 4, 2021, 6:30 – 8:00 pm</strong></p>
                <p>Whether you are actively considering home education or are just  curious about how it is done, you are invited to attend <em>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in  Massachusetts.</em> The free virtual program will be sponsored by the Amesbury  Public Library, 149 Main St,  Amesbury, MA on Thursday, February 4, 2021, 6:30 – 8:00 pm.</p>
                <p>This workshop will cover Massachusetts homeschool  guidelines; the history of homeschooling in MA; writing your education plan;  choosing a form of evaluation; and local homeschool policies. There will be  plenty of time for questions and discussion.</p>
                <p>The program will be presented by Milva McDonald. Milva is  the mother of four adult children, all of whom homeschooled for all or most of  their childhood and teenage years. She began homeschooling in 1991, after  reading an essay by John Taylor Gatto and realizing school and the PTA weren't  for her. She's a co-founder of Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts,  and served as a support group leader, field trip organizer, and potluck host  for many joyful homeschooling years. Her books include <em><a href="resources.html">Slow Homeschooling</a></em> and <em><a href="resources.html">Unschoolers.</a></em> She blogs at <a href="https://apotlucklife.com/" target="_blank">www.apotlucklife.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Admission is free, but <a href="https://www.eventkeeper.com/code/ekform.cfm?curOrg=AMESBURY&curID=485543" target="_blank">preregistration is required</a>.</p>
                <p>Space is limited and spots are allotted on a first come,  first served basis.</p>
                <p>Please respect AHEM&rsquo;s  mission to empower individuals through education by not soliciting for your  business at this event. </p>
