				<h2>Conform to Forms?: "Grey" Areas in the Law</h2>
<p>With so many new homeschoolers, AHEM has been seeing an uptick in questions about approval and other issues. Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, not by statutes, there is a lot that is not clearly laid out or that is open to interpretation. The following article attempts to unravel some of the murkier areas. We encourage all homeschoolers to read the <a href="ma_hs_law.html">court decisions</a>, which can be found on our website, for themselves. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

				<h2>The Year in Review from AHEM!</h2>
				<h4>Please consider AHEM when you are making <a href="support.html">end-of-year charitable donations!</a></h4>
<h3>Highlights of 2021</h3>
			  <p>2021 saw sustained interest in homeschooling. While not as busy as 2020, you can see in the chart below that in 2021, we still had increased visits to our website compared to the years prior to the pandemic.</p>

                             <h4>by Carol Moxley</h4>
              <h3>You did it!</h3>
		   <p>You made the decision to homeschool, and you found other          homeschoolers to help enrich your homeschooling experience. Great! But,          for some reason, you still feel like you're always on the periphery of          the group. Approaching a cluster of moms at park day is awkward; asking          to be included in a co-op is unthinkable; having a real friend to call          up on the phone is still out of reach. The support you need has to be          there somewhere—others seem to have found it—but how do you go about          forming the network you so desperately need? <a href="news-archives/2021/20211202_i_sought.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
