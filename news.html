			  <h2>Conform to Forms?</h2>
                  <p>One  of the most frequent questions AHEM gets is about forms or applications. Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, not by statute, there is a lot that is either not clearly laid out or that is open to interpretation. The following attempts to unravel one of the murkier areas. We encourage all homeschoolers to read <a href="ma_hs_law.html">the court decisions</a> for themselves. </p>
				<p>Although it is not required to fill out a school-generated form to homeschool in Massachusetts, some school officials find that forms make their lives easier, and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				
			    <h2>The Art of Motherhood: Taking Care of Ourselves (To Remind Myself)</h2>
              <h4>By Erin Matica</h4>
                        <p>When we are pregnant and while our children are very young, our focus and energy seem to be only about them. That is how it should be. All mammal species, most birds, and even some reptiles, fish, and insects take exquisite care of their young. The robins nesting in our barn eaves seem to have boundless energy brooding, feeding, protecting, nest cleaning, etc. The chicks grow fast and fledge within weeks, but during that nestling stage the parents are working non-stop. Many will continue to feed and look after their young even after they've fledged. <a href="news-archives/2021/20211111_art_of_motherhood.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Ask AHEM: Online Private Schools

				<p>This week we continue our <em>Ask AHEM</em> series in which we address some of the questions AHEM has received about homeschooling in Massachusetts. To access our one-on-one contacts program and get your questions answered, <a href="one-on-one.html">click here</a>. If you have questions or topics you'd like to suggest for this series, you can email AHEM at <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">info@ahem.info</a>.</p>

				<h2>Maintaining Homeschool Freedom</h2>
				<p>Would a&nbsp;statute serve us better than the current case law?  Why can’t all homeschoolers in Massachusetts participate in school activities?  Shouldn’t we get vouchers or tax credits to defray the cost of homeschooling?  Below, we consider whether these ideas would expand or diminish homeschooling  freedom. <a href="news-archives/2024/20241017_freedom.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

			  <h2 id="survey">AHEM Questionnaire on Homeschooling Policy and Practice</h2>
			  <p>Every year we do surveys to see what issues homeschoolers in Massachusetts are having and how reporting requests have changed from year to year. Whether you have had issues reporting in your town or not, your responses help us. Please consider taking a few minutes to respond. Results will be published in an upcoming AHEM newsletter.</p>

				<h2>End-of-Year Evaluations Survey Results</h2>
					     <p>Every summer AHEM sends out  a survey asking about end-of-year evaluations, including what form was used and what response, if any, was received. We are happy to say that the situation in  Massachusetts seems to be little changed in this regard. Most homeschoolers choose to submit a progress report and receive neutral or positive feedback from their districts.</p>
         <p>Altogether we received 241 responses this year. The vast majority of  respondents, approximately 73%, reported that they submitted a progress report as their end-of-year evaluation for the 2023-2024 school year.</p>
		 <p>This year for the first time we looked at how many of you reported submitting  more than one method of evaluation and found that almost 10% of you do report sending in multiple forms of evaluation with the most common combination (just  shy of 8% of total respondents) being progress reports and work samples. As a reminder, only one form of evaluation should be necessary. <a href="methods_eval.html">See more information on evaluations here</a>.</p>

				<h2>Homeschooling High School FAQ</h2>
		   <h3>Reporting</h3>
         <h4>If I am withdrawing my child from high school to homeschool, what do I need to do?</h4>
		   <p>You can withdraw your child and begin homeschooling at any age and at any point in the school year. If your child is under 16, see <em>Getting Started Homeschooling</em> for how to submit an education plan.</p>
         <p>If your child is 16 or older, you do not have to submit an education plan, but you should officially withdraw your child. If your child has done some high school, obtain a copy of their transcript when you withdraw.

				<h2>Homeschooling Styles</h2>
			  <h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
                <p>One of the most frequent questions we receive from new  homeschoolers is: “How do I do the academics?” The short answer is: “However  you like!” In Massachusetts we have a lot of leeway in terms of what, when, and  how to teach. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210826_styles.html">Read more ▸ </a> </p>

				<h2>Step One: DON'T PANIC</h2>
<p>The guidebook known as  <em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (from the novel of the same name) is said  to have on its cover these words: DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</p>
  <p>If I were making a guidebook on homeschool reporting, I  would take a page (pun intended) from Douglas Adams and start the same  way.</p>
  <p>Maybe your town has a new homeschool policy. Maybe they are  making requests they never have before. Maybe instead of approving your  education plan, they are asking for more information. Maybe you are just new  and nervous about sending in your first education plan.</p>
  <p>Whatever your situation, the first step is the  same:<strong> DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</strong></p>

				<h2>Overreach, Reasonable . . . or Essential?</h2>
			<h3>What if your town asks for more?</h3>
		  <p>Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, there are “gray” areas. This does not mean, however, that we are without guidance. The law itself gives guidelines for what sorts of requests towns can make.  </p>
				<p>On the positive side, <em>Care and Protection of Charles</em> lays out four factors that may be considered in determining whether to approve a home education plan. These are: <a href="news-archives/2022/20220922_essential.html">Read more ▸</a></p>

				<h2>In Praise of Park Days</h2>
				<h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
			  <p>Park days have long been a staple of my family&rsquo;s homeschooling  life. With four kids, these informal, weekly gatherings have provided everyone  (even mom) with an opportunity to make friends and socialize in a way that no  co-op we found ever could. Park days were the one constant in our schedule from  year to year. (My high school age daughter did the recorded version of Spanish  3 because the live class would have interfered with park day. One has to have  priorities, you know.)</p>
				<p>Park days are a  melting pot. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240425_park.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Policy and Practice Survey Results</h2>
	     <p>Every year, AHEM sends out a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">survey</a> asking homeschoolers across the  state about their town’s homeschooling policies and about their  interactions with school officials.</p>
		     <p>
		     We use this information in two ways. As we answer questions through our <a href="one-on-one.html">One-on-One Contacts</a> program, we refer  to the database to see the experiences of other homeschoolers in a  given town. The responses also give us a snapshot of homeschooling policy and  practice trends over time so we can see if there are broad changes that are  occurring across the state.</p>

<h2>Resources for Homeschooling High School</h2>
		   <p>Whether you already have  teens or are just planning the future, some of the most common questions  we get are: <q>What about high school?</q> <q>Can my homeschooled child get into  college?</q> <q>How can my child access standardized testing?</q> <q>How do they get a diploma  and how can I create a transcript?</q>

				<h2>"Hybrid" Homeschooling</h2>              
		   <p>More and more frequently we are seeing questions about<q>hybrid homeschooling,</q> the idea being that someone can homeschool but drop their child off at some kind of <q>program,</q> either for a few days a week or full-time. Others when speaking of <q>hybrid</q> schooling may mean homeschooling    while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a coop, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>
              <p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in Massachusetts. You are either enrolled in school, or you are not. When a homeschooler takes classes at a public school, the school does not receive per pupil funding for that student. Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible for an enrolled student to work out an arrangement with their school to do part of their schooling at home, but this would be up to individual schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you&rsquo;re either in or you&rsquo;re out.</p>
                           <p>
                           As long as there have been homeschoolers, they have chosen to use the resources of their community to augment their experiences. Many    museums, nature sanctuaries, tutoring centers, private instructors, performing arts organizations, and libraries offer classes and       activities for homeschoolers. The availability of homeschoolers to enroll in programs during daytime hours offers opportunities to        fill otherwise empty spaces. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240125_hybrid.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
              <h2>Unsnarling <em>Charles</em></h2>
		   <p>Understanding  Massachusetts homeschooling law is not a straightforward undertaking. Yet it is  an important one. Once you understand your rights, you can stand up for them.  Homeschooling in Massachusetts is a purely local undertaking, with each  district performing oversight functions. (The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has no authority to approve or disapprove homeschooling plans, and in  fact, plays no role whatsoever in the implementation of homeschooling regulation  in our state.) The following is our own interpretation of <em><a href="charles.html">Charles's</a></em> intent  regarding issues such as prior approval, written approval, evaluation, mid-year  changes, and testing, and does not constitute legal advice; it is for  informational purposes only. <a href="unsnarling_charles.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
				<h2>The S-Word</h2> 
		   <h3>How to Think About the Socialization Question</h3>
<h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I’d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one’s  ability to be relational—to form,   build, and negotiate relationships. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220811_sword.html">Read more ▸</a></p>
       
				<h2>Word Cloud</h2>
<h3>A look at the topics tackled by our One-on-One Contacts in 2023</h3>
	<p>If you have ever sent a homeschool question to AHEM, chances are good someone  in the community has had a similar question. According to the numbers,  the most frequently used words in 2023 were: homeschool (46%), district  (34%), education plan (24%), approval (12%), application (11%),  superintendent (8%), services (7%), register (6%), and IEP (5%).</p>
  <p>AHEM’s one-on-one volunteers offer information and engage with you to address  each question, whether you are just looking into homeschooling,  withdrawing mid-year and wondering if your district needs to approve your  plan before you start, or need a sounding board for how to respond to your  school district. <a href="news-archives/2024/20240104_word_cloud.html">Read more ▸ </a></p>
