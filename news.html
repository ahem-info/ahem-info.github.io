			  <h2>Homeschooling Teens: The World Is Your Oyster</h2>
	<p>Homeschooling high school is great preparation for life  after homeschooling, helping to hone dreams and skills to attain what you want.  You get to live your life now, not just &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; for the future. It allows  for:</p>
		<ul class="nested">	   
	        <li>Time and  space to explore and delve into interests</li>
	  		<li>Real world  experience</li>
	  		<li>Self-paced  study (faster or slower)</li>
	  		<li>Flexible  scheduling</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>What about socializing?</h3>
	  <p>The norm in our culture is school, which means having a set  group of peers with whom you spend all day, every day. In the real world,  that’s not how people meet and make friends. They do meet people and make  friends though, in various settings. Just because you are a high school aged  homeschooler, doesn’t mean all your friends have to be high school aged  homeschoolers. <a href="news-archives/2022/20221013_oyster.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>So Your Child Wants to be an Artist</h2>
    <h3>Advice for Applying to Art School</h3>   
		<h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
	 		<p>I have one child whom we always knew would be an artist.  From age two when she drew sad spiders obsessively, her calling was clear. At  age seven, we took her to a program at the American Textile History Museum in  Lowell (now, sadly, defunct) and had to pull her away from the hands-on loom  exhibit to give other children a chance. Today she is a senior at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) majoring in textiles, and weaving specifically, with a  minor in painting.</p>
     		<p>While I am no expert, I thought today I would share what we  have learned about applying to art schools. <a href="news-archives/2022/20221006_art_school.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

			<h2>Overreach, Reasonable . . . or Essential?</h2>
			<h3>What if your town asks for more?</h3>
		  <p>Because homeschooling in Massachusetts is governed by case law, there are “gray” areas. This does not mean, however, that we are without guidance. The law itself gives guidelines for what sorts of requests towns can make.  </p>
				<p>On the positive side, <em>Care and Protection of Charles</em> lays out four factors that may be considered in determining whether to approve a home education plan. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220922_essential.html">Read more &gt;&gt; </a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Styles</h2>
				  <h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
                <p>One of the most frequent questions we receive from new  homeschoolers is: &ldquo;How do I do the academics?&rdquo; The short answer is: &ldquo;However  you like!&rdquo; In Massachusetts we have a lot of leeway in terms of what, when, and  how to teach. </p>
              <h3>What to teach</h3>
                  <p>The Massachusetts <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter69/Section1D" target="_blank"><strong>General </strong><strong>Laws chapter 69, section 1D</strong></a> lists as core subjects mathematics, science  and technology, history and social science, English, foreign languages, and the  arts. Subjects from <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter71" target="_blank"><strong>Chapter 71</strong></a> Sections 1 and 3 include orthography, reading, writing, the  English language and grammar, geography, arithmetic, drawing, music, the  history and constitution of the United States, the duties of citizenship,  health education, physical education, and good behavior. These subjects need to  be covered at some point in your child’s education. You do not have to do every  subject every year. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210826_styles.html">Read more &gt;&gt; </a></p>
				<h2>Homeschooling Fact Check: Approval Letters</h2>
				<p><em>This week we continue our <q>Homeschooling Fact Check</q> series in which we examine some of the most common questions we receive and some of the biggest myths about homeschooling in Massachusetts.  If you have questions or topics you'd like to suggest for this series, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Fact Check Suggestion">info@ahem.info</a>.</em>  </p>

				<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
<p>July 31, 2022 saw the formal end of the current legislative session. None of the bills that AHEM has been tracking moved out of committee. The current legislative session will end in December. It is unlikely these bills will have any more activity, as the energy of the legislature turns to fall  elections, and the House and Senate meet only in informal sessions. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220901_leg_update.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2><q>Hybrid Homeschooling</q></h2>
		   <p>The term <q>hybrid homeschooling</q> is being bandied about a lot this summer, with one  idea being that someone can homeschool, but drop their child off at some kind of  <q>program</q> for one or two days a week, or more. Other definitions might be  homeschooling while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a  co-op, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>

<p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in Massachusetts. You are  either enrolled in school, or you are not. When a homeschooler takes classes at  a public school, the school does not receive per pupil funding for that  student. Theoretically it’s possible for an enrolled student to work out an  arrangement with their school to do part of their schooling at home, but this  would be up to individual schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you’re  either in or you’re out. <a href="news-archives/2020/20200723_hybrid_hs.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>Student Charlie Cards 2022</h2>

				<h2>The S-Word</h2> 
		   <h3>How to Think About the Socialization Question</h3>
<h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I’d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one’s  ability to be relational—to form,&nbsp;  build, and negotiate relationships. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220811_sword.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>Home with Kids 24/7</h2>
				<p><em>Editor's note: In my own search for something to share with a mom considering homeschooling, I ran across this article that we published last year. I am sharing it again in the hopes that it will encourage you, whether you are new to homeschooling, a veteran, or just considering. </em></p>

<p>Maybe you have subscribed to our list or are visiting our website because you have decided unexpectedly to homeschool and now find yourself at home all day with your kids. Here I draw on the wisdom of practicing homeschoolers with tips for managing your day. Trying to recreate school at home can be stressful. And goodness knows, none of us need more stress in our lives. So here is a short list of tips for being around your kids 24/7 that have been successful strategies for many a homeschooling family: <a href="news-archives/2021/20210913_24-7.html">Read more&gt;&gt;</a></p>

			  <h2>Conform to Forms?</h2>
           <p>Although  it is not required to fill out a school-generated form to homeschool in  Massachusetts, some school officials find that forms make their lives easier,  and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. </p>
         <p>Some  homeschoolers have a philosophical objection to filling out a form from the  school. It is always fine to just submit your education plan instead of filling  out the form. You may have some back and forth with the school about it. </p>
         <h3>Adapting the school&rsquo;s form</h3>
         <p>For  many homeschoolers, the form is not inherently repugnant, but is confusing  since forms are never mentioned in Massachusetts law. Sometimes a school will send a form to fill out  even after you have submitted your education plan. To deal with this, homeschoolers who are  willing to submit their plan via form can simply cross out any items that are  not required. Examples include: <a href="news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>A Plethora of Resources</h2>
			 <h3>Navigating AHEM's Website &amp; Finding the Help You Need</h3>
           <p>Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts (AHEM) has  been helping homeschoolers in Massachusetts for almost two decades now. In that  time, we have heard a lot of stories, answered a lot of questions, and  accumulated a lot of resources. While we feel we have a lot to offer, we also  understand that it can be a lot to navigate, whether you are brand new to  homeschooling or an old-timer looking for the answer to a particular question.</p>
         <h4>To aid in the process, we offer the following quick guide to  finding what you need on the AHEM website:</h4>

				<h2>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Sophia Kornienko</h2>
		     <img src="images/kornienko.jpg" alt=""/>
				<h4>By Sophia Kornienko</h4>
<p>I usually say our family  are educational refugees. We have had to move countries to be able to  homeschool and we are about to move across the Atlantic to be able to continue  unschooling. We are seeking refuge from Europe&rsquo;s bulging institutional control  over learning and development as we want our children to continue  self-directing their learning process.</p>
     <p>My elder son Simon has always been a self-directed learner while  I have assumed the role of a facilitator. We have never restricted the time he  spent devouring educational apps and YouTube videos and often ran out of paper  while he tried to recreate everything he had read or watched. The whole  pavement around our apartment block in downtown Amsterdam was covered in  Japanese Katakana, Greek letters, the Beaufort scale charts, units of  measurement, and most commonly, geometric shapes and formulas.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Simon didn’t seem to have much interest in  playing with other children and was very asynchronous in his development of  practical skills, which alarmed a few state-sponsored experts. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220708_kornienko.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
		<h2>Library Love Letter</h2>
		   <h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
              <p>I          used to gather weekly with a group of pre-teen homeschooled boys at a          table in the local public library for the editorial board meeting of          their quarterly magazine, <em>Dr.          Information</em>. <em>Dr.          Information</em> featured a regular column called <q>Dr. Information Prescribes.</q> The boys came up with a topic, be it books,          games, movies, music or places to go, and they brainstormed some of          their favorites to list. One issue's topic was <q>Destinations</q> and in          the midst of various fun spots such as local ski resorts, amusement          parks, and bowling alleys, I heard a loud suggestion of <q>Robbins          Library,</q> followed by a chorus of agreement. No sarcasm here: the local          public library was truly one of their favorite destinations.</p>
                           <p>Twenty years later, public libraries,          adept at changing with the times to meet local community needs, remain          gold mines for families engaged in home-based education. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220630_library_love.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: End-of-Year Evaluations</h2>

          <p> <a href="charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others,</em> 399  Mass. 324 (1987)</a> says that school  officials and parents should agree on a method of evaluation that may include  one of the following approaches: standardized testing, periodic progress  report, or dated work samples. Other methods of assessment, if mutually agreed  upon by parents and school officials, are also allowed. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220616_end_year.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

         <p>The first step to start officially homeschooling in  Massachusetts is to submit an education plan to your local school superintendent  or school committee. We suggest submitting your education plan a couple of  weeks before school starts if you can, but you can remove a child from school  at any time during the year. And remember, get a receipt. <a href="getting_started.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

Practices can change rapidly so you should always check with the          College Board and the schools you are applying to for updates. There          are many pieces to the college application process. Today we will look          at: applying for financial aid, creating transcripts, recommendations          and school profiles, the student's part of the application, and          lastly a few words on choosing schools to apply to. <a href="news-archives/2021/20211014_college_part_2.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

		   <h3>Part 1: Homeschooling High School</h3>
         <h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
         <p>As I write this I have two kids in college and two in high school, including a high school senior who is applying to colleges this year. None of them ever attended a brick-and-mortar school before going to college. Below are some thoughts on how to do high school as a homeschooler. These reflect my experiences; your mileage may vary, as they say. I will add that while we are not unschoolers, neither have we used a traditional approach to education. My philosophy of education largely mirrors the Charlotte Mason style with lots of living books, art, and nature, and no formal testing. In a follow-up, I will talk more specifically about the college application process. <a href="news-archives/2021/20210923_college_part_1.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h4>By Patrick Sullivan</h4>
	     <p>We began our homeschool journey, after our  twin boys, John and Kevin turned six. For about a year or two before, my wife  Kerry and I had discussed the educational options available to us. We had  spoken to friends who were already homeschooling and read some homeschooling  books by various authors such as <em>The  Lost Tools of Learning</em> by Dorothy Sayers.</p>
		    
		    <p>My wife and I were both products of the public schools and so it was a bit  surprising to our friends and family and perhaps to ourselves that we chose the  homeschooling path. Initially, our extended family was a bit perplexed at our  approach, but it was respected and was never really a problem.</p>
  <p>
		    We began with the <q>let&rsquo;s see how it goes this year</q> approach and ended up  following that for nine years! <a href="news-archives/2022/20220331_sullivan.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

				<h2>Summary of Education Plan Submission Survey</h2>
		   <p>We set up the survey to collect empirical data about:</p>

		   <li>the use of online forms to submit education plans</li>
			   <li>the request for documentation beyond an education plan</li>
			   <li>the request to register a homeschooled student</li>

		   <h3>Use of online forms to submit education plans</h3>
           <img src="images/202202_forms.png" alt=""/>
<p>Schools often use <a href="https://www.ahem.info/news-archives/2021/20210716_forms.html">forms as administrative tools</a> in an attempt to standardize information about homeschooled students.

                             <p>
                             When I toured the high school that I          would be attending from ninth to twelfth grade, I admit that I was feeling a          little nervous. It was an anxious feeling that was a lot          bigger than when I was moving from elementary to          middle school. However, something else didn’t feel          right. When the school tour was over, I began getting a          tickly feeling in my throat. When I was born, I had to have a          trach put in to help me breathe better. I’ve had it forever,          so we have to take extra good care of it by cleaning and suctioning it          to keep me healthy. As it turns out, the high school was an          old building. The air quality would not be good for my          trach, so Mom, Dad, and I got together to think about what we should          do. Mom, who’s always concerned about what happens to my trach was          terrified of sending me to a school that was unhealthy for me, and I          was nervous about getting suctioned every single day throughout the          school year. It’s safe to say we were both on the same page, so what          could we do instead? Eventually, with a little bit of          research, Mom suggested that we try homeschooling. It was a          big risk, but it was the only alternative we could think of. I never          knew how much fun I’d have throughout those four years. This is          the story of my experience as a homeschooler. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220303_wachta.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
			  <h2>Homeschooling Fact Check: Approval</h2>

If you have questions or topics you'd like to suggest for this series, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?Subject=Fact Check Suggestion">info@ahem.info</a>. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220224_fact_1.html">Read more &gt;&gt; </a> </p>
				<h2>AHEM Needs You!</h2>
		   <h3>Your skills,  expertise, and helping hands!</h3>
           <p>AHEM is “staffed” by a small handful of currently homeschooling  or formerly homeschooling parent volunteers.&nbsp;To stay viable, we need young  families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent homeschooling  as an educational option to step up and help out if Massachusetts homeschoolers  are&nbsp;to keep the right to homeschool the way they want to homeschool. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220217_volunteers.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
				<h2>Meet          Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Young People's Society of Storywriters</h2>
            <img src="images/amazon/Unlocked.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>By Isabella Watkins</h4>
		   <p>Homeschooling          is ideal for the writing process. It not only gives you time to work on          your craft, it also gives you the freedom to work with whomever you want.          Writing with a group of friends who feel like family has helped my          writing improve, and sharing my writing with supportive people has          heightened my confidence in my work. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220210_unlocked.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

			  <h2>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h2>
                   <p>This time of year we      begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already      worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are      being asked for a midyear report. The following is a revised version of <a href="progress_reports.html">our article on progress reports.</a></p> 
		      <h4>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable      form of evaluation.</h4>
                   <p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of      their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <em><a href="charles.html">CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399      Mass. 324 (1987)</a></em> clearly outlines three forms of evaluation:      “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted      for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated      work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340)      Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility. <a href="news-archives/2022/20220127_your_progress_report.html">Read more &gt;&gt;</a></p>
