<ol class="faq">
		<li><h4 id="mcas"> Do homeschoolers take the MCAS?</h4>
Homeschoolers are neither required, nor are they allowed, to take MCAS. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="diploma"> Do homeschoolers receive a public school diploma?</h4>
Homeschooled students are not permitted to participate in the MCAS and, therefore, cannot attain a public high school diploma. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
	<li>
	  <h4 id="extracurr"> May homeschoolers participate in extracurricular activities, high school sports, or academic classes?</h4>
Decisions regarding homeschoolers’ participation in any public school offerings are made at the discretion of local districts. The <a href="http://www.miaa.net/gen/miaa_generated_bin/documents/basic_module/MIAA_Handbook19_21.pdf" target="_blank">Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA)</a> policy removes obstacles to homeschoolers’ participation, but does not guarantee access. MIAA member schools still have the final say when it comes to allowing homeschooled students to join their athletic teams. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>	
	<li><h4 id="sped"> Are homeschoolers eligible for special education services provided by the public school?</h4>
Eligible Massachusetts homeschoolers are legally entitled to receive special services through the public schools. See <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/sped/advisories/2018-1.html" target="_blank">MA DESE Administrative Advisory SPED 2018-1</a><a>.</a> <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="eval"> May school officials require more than one form of evaluation?</h4>
	    <em><a href="charles.html"> Charles</a></em> states that school officials and parents should agree on a method of evaluation, which can include one of the following: standardized testing, a periodic progress report, or dated work samples. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="test"> May school officials require testing?</h4>
The question of whether school officials can require testing is not answered definitively in Massachusetts law. The court in <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a></em> allowed parents to retain a choice in how their children are evaluated by citing other acceptable forms of evaluation and stating that they should be “subject to the approval of the parents.” The court also stated that any condition of approval must be “essential” to ensuring the state's interest in the education of children, and put the burden of proving that standard on the school district. <a href="#top">Back to top. </a></li>
<li><h4 id="meeting"> Can school officials require a face-to-face meeting with parents in order to approve an education plan?</h4>
No. According to <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a>,</em> requirements for approving a plan must be “essential.” (see <a href="#test">#6</a> above) <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="reporting"> How often is reporting required?</h4>
	    <em><a href="charles.html"> Charles</a></em> does not specify any specific deadline for submitting an education plan. Generally families submit their education plans annually a few weeks before the start of the school year. Parents who withdraw their child from school should submit their education plan prior to withdrawing their child. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="sched"> May school officials require a daily schedule?</h4>
No. Following a schedule is not an important consideration in a home school where “...the perception and use of time... are different.” (<a href="brunelle.html"><em>Brunelle</em></a>) <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="curr"> Do homeschoolers have to use the public school curriculum?</h4>
Home school proposals are expected to be “equal in thoroughness and efficiency” to the instruction provided in public schools, but <em><a>Charles</a></em> does not make reference to nor require the use of any specific materials or resources and states that the school may not dictate the manner in which the subjects will be taught. <a>Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="count"> Are homeschoolers included in the public school student enrollment count?</h4>
No. Schools receive no funding for homeschooled students located in their district. <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="moreinfo"> Can the school ask for more information in an education plan?</h4>
Yes. The school must detail what needs revision, and give parents the opportunity to revise their plan.  <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="disapprove"> What if the school disapproves the education plan?</h4>
If, having submitted a plan, parents begin homeschooling without approval, the school assumes the burden of showing that the education plan does not equal <q>in thoroughness and efficiency, and in the progress made therein, that in the public schools in the same town....</q> In <em><a href="charles.html">Charles</a>,</em> the court recommended that <q>the parties… proceed expeditiously in a serious effort to resolve the matter by agreement.</q> <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
		<li><h4 id="truancy"> Is it appropriate to file truancy charges against a homeschooling family?</h4>
Truancy charges against homeschoolers who have submitted an education plan are not warranted. If the school questions an education plan, the appropriate course is to work with the family to expedite approval (see <a href="#moreinfo">12</a> and <a href="#disapprove">13</a> above). <a href="#top">Back to top.</a></li>
