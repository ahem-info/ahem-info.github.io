      <h1>Unschooling  as a Feminist Act</h1>
        <h6>By Wendy Priesnitz</h6>
     
      <p>When I was a young mother,  I wore a t-shirt with the words: “The hand that rocks the cradle rocks the  boat.” The phrase put a spin on a 19th century poem entitled “The Hand That  Rocks the Cradle Rules the World” by American poet William Ross Wallace. I understood  at the time that becoming a mother was increasing my desire to create change in  the world, although I didn’t know where that would lead me. I had already  realized that, as the feminist movement espoused, the personal is political. I  had already challenged a few assumptions about how life was supposed to work –  including rejecting both the style in which I’d been parenting and the  institution of school as an effective vehicle for education.</p>
      <p>As much as I didn’t like  the rules of the status quo, I also didn’t like labels – even the ones that  accompanied my rebellion. In fact, I’ve fought my whole adult life to avoid  descriptions of myself that involve isms and ists. I dislike being referred to  as an environmentalist, an activist, a feminist, a humanist, a homeschooler, a  radical unschooler, a life learner… although each of those words describes an  aspect of my life and work. As helpful as such labels can be to connect with  others who think similarly, they can also constrict, separate, polarize,  alienate and confuse. And because they name groups with a specific set of  “membership requirements,” they help perpetuate stereotypes.</p>
      <p>School is where we learn  to sort, segment and label in that manner, where knowledge is broken up in to  subjects and students are grouped by age and their ability to perform on tests.  And the post-secondary world has turned segmentation of knowledge into an art.  So I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised the first time an academic  feminist scorned me because of my advocacy of life learning and its apparent  support for the stay-at-home mom. However, it had never occurred to me that  unschooling and feminism were mutually exclusive. In fact, I am quite certain  that it, in all its label-defying glory, is the ultimate feminist act, for a variety  of reasons on which I’ll elaborate in this article. But over the years, I’ve  encountered many people – including some self-doubting life learning feminist  moms – for whom the picture isn’t quite that clear.</p>
      <p>I wasn’t always quite so  sure of myself and once upon a time was even apt to wonder if my outlook on  education was at odds with some of my other progressive stances. That changed  when I began to observe young children and how little respect they and their  caregivers receive.</p>
      <p>I trained to be a teacher  in 1969 but realized after just a few months that neither I nor most of the  students wanted to be in the classroom. So I quit teaching. Researching a more  suitable career and curious about how children learn (something that hadn’t  been a major part of the teachers’ college curriculum), I spent some time  working at a daycare center.</p>
      <p>Daycare centers were not  that prevalent in the early 1970s, but my developing feminism led me to believe  they were crucial if society was to move beyond the nuclear family and its  smothering hierarchy. But I was astonished at how undervalued and underpaid the  entirely female staff was, especially for work that was so stressful and so  important…and at what uninspiring places the centers were. I am a questioner by  nature, and that experience inspired a lot of questions: Why was our society  apparently undervaluing this work? Was it because women were doing it? Or did  we value the care of the next generation so little? What is “liberated” about  paying other women a minimal wage to look after our children so that we can  have high paying careers? Does one have to have a paid job in order to be a  feminist? Why do women have to embrace the male model in order to challenge  patriarchy? Is there a third way?</p>
      <p>My husband Rolf and I soon  chose to begin our family. Once pregnant, I struggled to understand why  feminism wanted me to make a choice between my rights and those of my future  children. We decided to create a life that would affirm the rights of all  members of our family. And thus it became my life’s work to advocate for  children’s right to be raised and educated with respect and without the “isms”  – sexism, racism, classism, ageism, consumerism and other elitist or  destructive social influences.</p>
      <p>Motherhood focused my  early political consciousness. It helped me understand how the choices I make  in my personal life are linked to those I make on a larger scale. I remember  thinking that a mother’s body is the first environment for human life, so I’d  better ensure I was providing a clean, nurturing place for my unborn child to  grow, as well as ensuring a safe, respectful world for her to live in after  birth. And that’s when I began to weave change-making into my life.</p>
      <p>At the personal level, one  of the things this meant was that our children would learn without school. And  so my husband and I set about creating circumstances to allow that to happen.  With the panache of youth, we started the family business that publishes this  magazine, thinking we would all stay at home together for the next decade or  so, happily living, learning and making money together. While the fairy tale  didn’t turn out exactly as hoped, our lives taught our children – by  experience, which is the best kind of learning – about making a living, about  working out differences, about the need to be critical of the power structures  in society and in the microcosm of family and personal relationships…and much  more.</p>
      <p>In some ways, what I was  living has since been defined as “empowered mothering” by York University  Women’s Studies professor and founder of the Association for Research on  Mothering Andrea O’Reilly. However, I don’t identify with this label any more  than any others because O’Reilly’s stance is woman-centered, rather than  child-centered. She describes empowered mothering as using the role of mother  to challenge systems that smother women’s choice, autonomy and agency. And that  seems to leave out children’s choice, autonomy and agency. Dismantling  patriarchy is crucial to creating a whole society but we can’t accomplish that  by ignoring the rights of another group of people.</p>
      <p>Perhaps O’Reilly and  others in the educational industry think that our public schools are taking  care of the kids. But they’re not. As I wrote in my book Challenging  Assumptions in Education, our public school systems perpetuate social  hierarchies, disempower children, coerce them – supposedly for their own good –  and encourage a destructive level of consumerism and consumption. Furthermore,  they are not democratic because they don’t allow children and young people to  control their choices and their daily lives. School teaches submission to power  based on size, age, intellect and sometimes ability to bully, and there are  race, gender and class biases, and even sexual harassment. The very structure  of schools delivers a hidden socioeconomic curriculum of standardization,  competition and top-down management by experts.</p>
      <p>In short, schools – and  society in general – treat children the way women don’t want to be treated.  They don’t trust children to control their own lives, to keep themselves safe  and to make their own decisions. In this way, feminism and life learning are  one and the same because they trust people to take the paths that suit them  best.</p>
      <p>Aside from allowing  academic freedom, life learning is about living more mindfully – acting  altruistically (instead of earning gold stars or the approval of authority  figures), respecting individuals for who they are, overturning discrimination,  being aware of and remediating the conflicts inherent in our society, working  cooperatively, and learning about and improving the world by living in and  acting on it.</p>
      <p>Life learning parents care  deeply about children’s choice, autonomy and agency. They respect young  people’s right to make their own decisions (within parameters that address  their physical and emotional safety, of course). They understand that when  children are part of a community, they have an interest in making that  community function well, taking responsibility for their actions and  contributing to the group.</p>
      <p>One of the stereotypes  about life learning that results in feminist criticism is that of too much  togetherness – children who are home alone with mom all the time, tied to the  umbilical cord or the apron strings. On the surface, that’s based on ignorance.  But aside from the fact that life learning kids typically spend more time in  their communities exposed to a more diverse range of people and experiences  than kids in school, the apron strings criticism denigrates the value of the  mother-child relationship. Being an activist of any sort is more than  resisting; it’s also about providing positive alternatives. Parenting practices  like cosleeping, prolonged breastfeeding and family-based education are  powerful and nurturing alternatives, which provide the early security that  leads to independence.</p>
      <p>One of the questions I  asked almost 40 years ago – the one about paying for childcare in order to have  a career and retain the feminist label – is still on my mind. These days, some  feminists are working to solve that conundrum through the use of tax credits or  other methods of financially rewarding caregiving parents; others believe  higher quality childcare, workplace reform and better pay for childcare workers  is the solution.</p>
      <p>But there is, as I mused  so many years ago, a third way. What if we overturned the male model of success  that feminism adopted in creating equal opportunity for women? If we reject the  idea that success is only about money, we can forge new attitudes toward what’s  important in life. Challenging the notion that feminism relates only to equal  opportunity within the workplace and can only be obtained by a full-time paying  career is controversial, but there is a growing movement that questions the  tradition that well-being is based totally on economics. As I wrote in the last  issue of Natural Life, the Genuine Progress Indicator is one tool that has been  developed to factor caregiving, pollution and other positives and negatives  into the accounting that we know as GDP. One of the proponents of that idea is  feminist and environmentalist Marilyn Waring. The author of the book If Women  Counted, she was one of the first to suggest that the GDP sustains the  institutionalized enslavement of women by focusing solely on production and  consumption in the market sphere, thereby rendering women’s unpaid work  invisible.</p>
      <p>Taking the notion further,  Australian academic, author and social commentator Susan Maushart asserts that  motherhood needs to be at the center of human society, from which all social  and economic life should spin. Society needs to “acknowledge that bearing and  raising children is not some pesky, peripheral activity we engage in, but the  whole point,” she says. Warehousing kids in daycare or school so mothers can  get on with what they see as their real lives is not part of that vision, but  we need to find ways to ensure economic security for women of all classes, and  extend the vision to include fathers as well.</p>
      <p>It has been said that  feminism is the radical notion that women are people. Even more radical, I  would suggest, is the notion that was printed on a t-shirt my young daughters  once shared: “Kids are people too.” At this point in history, allowing them to  live and learn in the real world, unfettered by the discrimination inherent in  compulsory schooling, is the best way to honor that idea. We need to find ways  to make that possible without diminishing anyone else’s rights. Then we will  truly be on the way to creating a more egalitarian society.      </p>
