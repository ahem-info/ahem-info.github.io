                <h1>Transitioning a Family from School to Home  Education – Tips from the Rearview Mirror</h1>
              </strong></h2>
              <h6><strong>by Gina Beth Basteri</strong></h6>
              <p><br />                
              When I made the decision to remove my daughter from public school,  I delved into research mode. Learning all that I could about curricula,  educational philosophies, &quot;socialization,&quot; standard courses of  studies, how to get into college without a diploma, and anything else that came  to mind. While there are many articles out there that go over the “hows” of  taking a child out of school and where to begin home educating, I had a very  hard time finding any that went much beyond the standard “be sure to allow the  child to deschool.” And many were written by people who have never actually  gone through the process themselves. I am not an expert, but hindsight is  priceless. It is my hope that you will find these inside tips helpful to you,  as you begin your Home Ed journey.</p>
<h6>Decompressing vs. Deschooling</h6>
              <p> While deschooling of the child is very important, deschooling the  parents should really be the first step in the process. When you are raised to  believe that only accredited teachers can help someone learn, you have to build  yourself up and realize that no one is more qualified than you are to teach your child.  Parents need to break away from the thoughts of what “school” looks like and  begin to realize that “education” and “schooling” are not one and the same and  often, detrimental to the other. Most sources will advise that one month of  deschooling is needed for each year a child has been in a school system,  however for the parents I would, at the very least, double that amount of time. </p>
              <p>I like to think of this process more as a decompressing of the  learner within – the learner that generally gets squashed away in order to  conform and fit in within classroom settings. Both the parent and child need to  be allowed freedom to discover what being educated means to them. What is truly  important for your child to know? This is a question that only the parents and  the child can answer. Often the answer is very different from one family to  another and even from one child to the next within the same family. Children  who have been schooled need the chance to remember that learning is fun and  begin to enjoy learning again. When you take away rote memorization drills and  allow a child to explore what they find interesting, or what is needed to solve  a real problem, they rediscover the curiosity and enthusiasm that is frequently  suppressed by a system that needs everyone to remember the same information in  order to pass the test.</p>
              <p>A common misconception that the word deschooling brings to mind is  that the child is allowed to just “do nothing” which can make a lot of parents  uncomfortable. It is better to think of this time as allowing the family to  discover how they learn, what their interests are and what they want their  lives to be like. Children should be allowed freedom to discover what interests  them and how they best absorb information. Parents can encourage this discovery  by providing a multitude of resources, from traditional workbooks, to field  trips, to television series, to co-op classes and anything else that might  pique their interest in a subject. Learning styles can vary greatly and often a  child will enjoy math through hands-on manipulation of blocks, but enjoy  reading a great historical fiction series to learn about the Revolutionary War.  This time will allow you and your learner a chance to see what fits.</p>
              <p>It should also be a time when the child's circadian rhythms are  allowed to return to a natural state. Often children who are used to being told  what to do with every second of the day, have no idea when they are hungry,  thirsty, tired or even need to go to the bathroom. They have become trained to  sleep when told, eat when told, and hold “IT” for extended amounts of time when  necessary. This causes circadian rhythms to become nearly dormant in a child's  body. When given the chance, these natural feelings will return and a child  will have control of his or her body again, often leading to children who had  discipline and attention issues becoming far more content and attentive. This  is a factor that is very often overlooked by behaviorists within a school  environment, but has been noted time and again from parents who have removed  their children from the system.              </p>
              <h6>Swiss Cheese Knowledge Base</h6>
              <p>The most frequent question I see on home education forums from  parents who are thinking of taking this step is some variation of “What  curriculum should I use?” For the person asking, this seems like such a simple  question. Surely, my fourth grader in Wyoming should be learning the exact  same information as the fourth grader in Dakota. This could not be further from  the truth. Not only do different states teach different things at different  ages, different counties and even different schools within the same town teach  things differently. No matter what standard base is being used, not all fourth graders in  any system are going to learn the same information. For most home educators  this is even more of a widespread question because they tend to realize the  individual needs of each child and therefore can't tell you what curriculum to use  without having any idea what type of child would be using it. When you take a  child out of a system where one set of principles or standards is being taught,  it is not possible to pick up a catalog and order the fourth grade school  in a box set because you have no idea if that system is going to be aligned  with the previous one.
                </p>
              </p>
              <p>Another thing that is often not discussed in regard to where to  begin is the concept of a “Swiss cheese knowledge base.” Children who have been  in schools have often been taught a lot of information in a very disconnected  manner because the focus of so many schools is to teach to the test – CAT,  FCAT, MCAS, SAT, ACT or whatever acronym your state has chosen to best  “measure” output. This causes many children to have blocks of information  scattered with all kinds of holes where the information is missing or has not  been connected to anything to make it permanent in the child's memory. In order  to truly learn something it must be digested and connected with a real world  application or situation. This is why so many children learn from movies,  activities and games – they are using multiple senses and therefore can more  easily retain the information. I highly recommend approaching each topic as  though the child has never encountered it before. This allows you to set the  pace at which you move through things, skimming through content that seems to  be coming easily to the child, focusing on areas of great interest for as long  as the child wants, or slowing down and going deeper on something that needs  more time to be fully understood.</p>
              <h6>What About Socialization?</h6>
              <p>Inevitably the “S” word is always brought up during a transition  from a school system to home learning. For families who have been traditionally  educated it is hard to fathom how their children could possibly make friends or  learn to be productive citizens when they spend every day at home with only  their family to interact with. It may be hard for many parents to believe, but  although they may not be as “socialized” as their public school counterparts,  home educated children are generally more social and outgoing.  &quot;Socialization&quot; is manufactured, living and learning is natural.
  </p>
              </p>
              <p>A very important thing to keep in mind is also this: kids feed off  of the fears of their parents so it is important for the parents to assure  their children that they are not the only ones on the planet that have made the  choice to learn at home. Join online communities and local support groups to  connect with other home educators in your area. You may need to put yourselves  out there, even if it is outside of your comfort zone. By getting involved with  a wide variety of classes, hangouts, park days, co-ops, field trips etc. you  widen your chances of finding families with common interests and outlooks. It can  be difficult at times for kids to feel connected so try not to feel discouraged  if, after your first attempt, you don't meet anyone that your child hits it off  with. If you just keep trying you are likely to build friendships that are  based more on common interests, than on what class you randomly got placed  into. Many families find that their children develop bonds with people in the  community – local shop keepers, librarians, museum workers – because the kids  have a true and honest interest in obtaining knowledge from experienced adults,  rather than textbooks.</p>
              <h6>Just Live!</h6>
              <p>Once a family has their feet under them in this new world, they  tend to come to the realization that learning and life go hand in hand. You  will begin to see that kids absorb information when it is presented in a format  that resonates within them. I have heard story upon story of parents being  astounded at the wealth of knowledge that flows from their children’s mouths,  often on topics the parents themselves know nothing about. When given a chance  to follow their own interests, children learn more quickly and deeply than is comprehendible  by traditionally schooled parents. The greatest gift given to anyone is life  and the chance to just live it!              </p></td>
