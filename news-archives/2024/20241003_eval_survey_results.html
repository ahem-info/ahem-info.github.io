<h1>End-of-Year Evaluations Survey Results </h1>
	     <p>Every summer AHEM sends out  a survey asking about end-of-year evaluations, including what form was used and what response, if any, was received. We are happy to say that the situation in  Massachusetts seems to be little changed in this regard. Most homeschoolers choose to submit a progress report and receive neutral or positive feedback from their districts.</p>
         <p>Altogether we received 241 responses this year. The vast majority of  respondents, approximately 73%, reported that they submitted a progress report as their end-of-year evaluation for the 2023-2024 school year.</p>
		 <p>This year for the first time we looked at how many of you reported submitting  more than one method of evaluation and found that almost 10% of you do report sending in multiple forms of evaluation with the most common combination (just  shy of 8% of total respondents) being progress reports and work samples. As a reminder, only one form of evaluation should be necessary. <a href="../../methods_eval.html">See more information on evaluations here</a>.</p>
       <img src="../../images/202410_eval_types.png" alt="Evaluation type submitted"/> 
	 <p>Those submitting progress reports sometimes receive requests for changes or additional information. Specifically, 9%, received some sort of follow-up request.</p>
       <img src="../../images/202410_eval_follow_up.png" alt="Evaluation follow-up"/> 
		   <p>Those submitting work samples only rarely received further requests.</p>
       <img src="../../images/202410_eval_work_samples.png" alt="Work samples"/> 
	 <p>While only a small number of respondents reported having submitted standardized tests scores as their method of evaluation, none of these reported receiving any additional requests.</p>
       <img src="../../images/202410_eval_test.png" alt="Testing"/> 
	 <p>Thank you to all who participated in this survey. Your responses help us to continue to track homeschool reporting trends in Massachusetts.</p>
