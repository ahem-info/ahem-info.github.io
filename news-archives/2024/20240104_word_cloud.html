<h1>Word Cloud</h1>
<h2>A look at the topics tackled by our One-on-One Contacts in 2023</h2>
	<p>If you have ever sent a homeschool question to AHEM, chances are good someone  in the community has had a similar question. According to the numbers,  the most frequently used words in 2023 were: homeschool (46%), district  (34%), education plan (24%), approval (12%), application (11%),  superintendent (8%), services (7%), register (6%), and IEP (5%).</p>
  <p>
	  AHEM&rsquo;s one-on-one volunteers offer information and engage with you to address  each question, whether you are just looking into homeschooling,  withdrawing mid-year and wondering if your district needs to approve your  plan before you start, or need a sounding board for how to respond to your  school district. Common questions include:</p>
    <ul class="nested">
      <li>Do I meet with a principal?</li>
      <li>Can I use IEP services?</li>
      <li>A new superintendent is requesting new documentation, should I comply?</li>
      <li>We are moving to a new district. Do I need to enroll?</li>
      <li>Do I need to fill out my district&rsquo;s forms?</li>
      <li>What is the preferred method of reporting?</li>
    </ul>
<p>We strive to answer  your questions in a timely manner and offer thoughtful guidance on  follow-up actions if needed so you can proceed with confidence. Sometimes  we are able to direct you to the answer on the AHEM website, other times more assistance is  needed&mdash;understanding how case law works, addressing town extralegal  requests, or learning that in Massachusetts homeschoolers do not have to draft  a letter of intent but instead submit an education plan.</p>
<p>
<em>How it works</em>:  AHEM representatives review and respond to one-on-one inquiries  personalized to specific needs and circumstances of each  submission.</p>
<p>
<em>Why connect with AHEM</em>:  When you submit a question you have access to a diverse pool of  volunteers with many years of homeschool experience in Massachusetts that can  help guide you to information that allows you to become <a href="../../best-advocate.html">your own best advocate</a>. We can also  facilitate <a href="../../networking.html">community connections</a> and suggest <a href="../../resources.html">resources</a>.</p>
<p>
<em>Get involved</em>:  If you’re interested in contributing, consider <a href="../../vol_app.html">becoming a volunteer</a>.</p>
<p>
At AHEM we invite and encourage all homeschoolers to read through the website  to become familiar with Massachusetts laws, reporting, networking, and  resources. Our volunteers are available to answer any questions you may  have. <h4>Have a question  for us? </h4>
