           <h1>"Hybrid" Homeschooling</h1>              
		   <p>More and more frequently we are seeing questions          about<q>hybrid homeschooling,</q> the idea being that          someone can homeschool but drop their child off at some kind of          <q>program,</q> either for a few days a week or full-time. Others when          speaking of <q>hybrid</q> schooling may mean homeschooling          while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a coop,          or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>
                           <p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in          Massachusetts. You are either enrolled in school, or you are not. When          a homeschooler takes classes at a public school, the school does not          receive per pupil funding for that student. Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible          for an enrolled student to work out an arrangement with their school to          do part of their schooling at home, but this would be up to individual          schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you&rsquo;re either in or          you&rsquo;re out.</p>
                           <p>
                           As long as there have been homeschoolers, they have chosen to use the          resources of their community to augment their experiences. Many          museums, nature sanctuaries, tutoring centers, private instructors,          performing arts organizations, and libraries offer classes and          activities for homeschoolers. The availability of homeschoolers to          enroll in programs during daytime hours offers opportunities to          fill otherwise empty spaces. Using such resources brings          homeschoolers out into the community (contrary to popular belief,          homeschooling does not just happen in the home) and opens them up          to new and unique experiences that they might not otherwise          encounter.</p>
                           <p>Co-ops, groups of families who come together and share          in educating their children, have existed as long as homeschooling has.          They run the gamut. One co-op might rent a space and have parents          or hired instructors teach classes while parents and siblings gather on          site with some level of parental involvement required and a          fee to join. Another co-op might be a few families getting together          once or twice a week at someone&rsquo;s home, with parents rotating          responsibility for planning activities. Yet another might be a group of          families who get together once a week at a park for free play, and          various activities branch off from that, planned by and for subsets of          families.</p>
                           <p>Learning centers (also called <q>microschools</q>)          differ from the long-standing homeschool co-op model in that they are          drop-off centers, are run as businesses, and do not require          parental involvement. Where do such institutions, where large groups          of children are dropped off to be supervised by someone other than a          parent, fit into the Massachusetts regulatory scheme? On the face of          it, it would be logical to assume that they should fall under the          regulations for <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter76/Section1" target="_blank">approved private schools</a>, which          may allow part time participation of homeschoolers, or as licensed          day care centers. Some learning centers may be          using homeschooling law to skirt the regulations which          exist to protect children and workers. Rather than jumping through the          hoops necessary to get approval as a private school, or bearing the          scrutiny to be licensed as a day care center, many learning centers          simply require that in order to participate you be a homeschooler,          meaning that you have in hand an approved education plan from your          local district.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>As mentioned previously, homeschoolers have always taken          advantage of opportunities for group classes, private teachers, and          homeschool co-ops to supplement the learning they do at home. What&rsquo;s          relatively new is dropping your homeschooled child off for multiple          days a week, or even full time, at a building with a large group of          other children and an adult who is in charge. It is your duty as a          parent to safeguard the wellbeing of your children. We encourage all          parents to do their due diligence in vetting any services (especially          drop-off services) they use. Don't be shy about asking          pertinent questions, including:</p>
                           <ul class="nested">
                             <li>Are they approved by the local city or town as               a private school?</li>
                             <li>If not, are they a licensed day care provider?</li>
                             <li>What health and safety protocols are in place,               such as training in first aid, fire inspections, ratio of teachers               to children?</li>
                             <li>Are criminal background checks done for staff               and volunteers?</li>
                             <li>Do they carry insurance?</li>
                             <li>What is their philosophy (educational,               leadership structure) and what are their policies (safety,               discipline, parental involvement)?</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Keeping the distinction between homeschooling and          private schooling or day care helps preserve homeschooling          freedom. Homeschooling parents demanding accountability from          the businesses they utilize will strengthen and safeguard          homeschooling itself.</p>
