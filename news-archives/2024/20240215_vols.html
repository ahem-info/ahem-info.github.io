        <h1>AHEM Needs YOU!</h1>
		   <h3>Your skills,  expertise, and helping hands!</h3>
           <p>AHEM is <q>staffed</q> by a handful of currently homeschooling or  formerly homeschooling parent volunteers. To stay viable, we need young  families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent homeschooling  as an educational option to step up. Help out in order for Massachusetts homeschoolers   to keep the right to homeschool the way they want to homeschool.</p>
  <h4>Several opportunities are available:</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li><strong>Graphic Design</strong> We often supply materials like brochures to libraries or hand them out at presentations and we'd like to update our designs.</li>
           <li><strong>Help Plan Events </strong>We would love to resume more in-person or virtual events but need logistical help to make this       happen.</li>
           <li><strong>Town Point Person</strong> Town point people are independent, local volunteers who help others find social connection and       opportunities in their town. <a href="../../tpp.html">More info here.</a></li>
           <li><strong>Write </strong><em><strong>Meet Massachusetts       Homeschoolers</strong></em><strong> Piece</strong> Would you like to share your homeschooling       experience? We are seeking pieces for our <em>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers</em> feature. This is a great chance to talk about yourself, what makes your       homeschooling unique. We are not ageist and welcome writing by children,       teens, and adults. <a href="../../meet_ma_hsers.html">More info here.</a></li>
           <li><strong>Train to Provide One-on-One Help</strong> Are you an experienced homeschooler looking to help       others? Our one-on-one contacts respond to inquiries from       homeschoolers across the state. We will train and equip you to help with       this important part of our mission. <a href="../../vol_app.html">See our volunteer application.</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you are interested in any of these opportunities, or have  another skill or talent you think would be valuable to share, please <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">get in touch</a> or  fill out our <a href="../../vol_app.html">volunteer application</a> today. We are  more than happy to give you details.</p> 
		   <p>Thanks so much for considering!</p>
