				<h1>The Year in Review 2024</h1>
                   <p>As another year draws to a close, we at AHEM find ourselves grateful for the opportunity to walk with our own children through these formative years; for having additional time to listen and reflect on life; to learn and grow as families and a homeschooling community. AHEM is driven by the goal of supporting your family to nurture, learn with and support your children during these special years. It is a privilege to walk this path with you and we are grateful for your engagement with us!</p>
				   <p>At AHEM, we are committed to guiding homeschoolers and those exploring homeschooling to become their own best advocates. We pride ourselves on providing up-to-date information and comprehensive explanations about homeschooling requirements in Massachusetts. This dedication is reflected in our 5-star ratings from follow-up surveys conducted after our one-on-one consultations.</p>
				   <p>Our volunteers work diligently to ensure every inquiry is addressed within 24 hours, offering answers and the reassurance our community needs to proceed with confidence. As a fully volunteer-run nonprofit, we rely on the generosity of donors to sustain our essential        programs and services.</p>
				   <p>Your support is crucial in helping us continue our mission of empowering individuals and fostering connections within our community.        Join us in making a difference—every contribution counts!</p>
