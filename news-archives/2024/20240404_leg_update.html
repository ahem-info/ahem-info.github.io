  <h3>Bill regarding access to the MCAS exam</h3>
  <h4>H.506</h4>
           <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO THE MCAS EXAM by Bradley  H. Jones, Jr. - 20th Middlesex</p>
           <p>2/16/2023 House Referred to the Joint  Committee on Education<br>
           2/16/2023 Senate Senate concurred<br>
           9/20/2023 Hearing scheduled for 10/04/2023<br>
           2/20/2024 Reported favorably, referred to the committee on  House Ways and Means.</p>
           <p>SECTION 1. 
           Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department of  elementary and secondary education shall issue a report on the feasibility and  costs associated with non-public school students and home-schooled students in  grade 10 voluntarily taking the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System  exam; provided that said report shall be provided to the secretary of  administration and finance, the commissioner of elementary and secondary  education, and the clerks of the senate and house of representatives who shall  forward the same to the chair of the senate ways and means committee, the chair  of the house ways and means committee, and the house and senate chairs of the  joint committee on education within 6 months of the effective date of this act.</p>
  
  <p><em>Summary:  Would issue a report on allowing private and homeschooled students to take the  MCAS. AHEM contacted Rep. Jones and asked that &ldquo;and home schooled students&rdquo; be  removed from the language of the bill, as homeschoolers are included in the  category &ldquo;non-public school students&rdquo; and introducing the term &ldquo;home schooled&rdquo;  into statutory language begs for it to be defined.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>AHEM&rsquo;s  position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
         
  <h3>Bill regarding community college tuition</h3>
  <h4>S.1233</h4>
           <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION by John C. Velis - Hampden and  Hampshire</p>
          <p>2/16/2023 Senate Referred to the Joint  Committee on Labor and Workforce Development<br>
           2/16/2023 House House concurred<br>
           11/14/23 Joint Committee Hearing</p>
           <p>(1) To be eligible for  the scholarship a student shall be admitted to, and enrolled full-time in, an  eligible postsecondary program within five years following graduation, not  including time spent in the United States Armed Forces, from an eligible high school  in Massachusetts, or completion of high school as a Massachusetts home school  student, or obtaining a GED® or HiSET® diploma.</p>
  <p><em>Summary: This bill would create the Massachusetts Workforce  Opportunity Scholarship. The problem with it is that it introduces the term  &ldquo;home school&rdquo; into law, and would require defining what qualifies as completion  of high school. AHEM has contacted Senator Velis and asked him to consider  amending the language to not include the term &ldquo;home school.&rdquo;.</em></p>
    <p><em>AHEM  position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
          
           <p>AHEM will continue to monitor these and any additional bills  that may be filed during the 193rd Session that could affect homeschooling in  Massachusetts.</p>
