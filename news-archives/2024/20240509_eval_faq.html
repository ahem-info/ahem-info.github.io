         <h1>Frequently Asked Questions: End-of-Year Evaluations</h1>
         <p>It's that time of  year. Many of us are finishing up one school year and thinking about reporting  for the next. Whether this is your first year reporting or you are an  experienced homeschooler, AHEM has answers to all your evaluation  questions. For more on each of these topics, please visit our website.</p>
           
           <h3>What forms of  evaluation are acceptable?</h3>
           <a href="../../charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF  CHARLES &amp; others</em>, 399 Mass. 324  (1987)</a> says that school officials and parents should agree on a  method of evaluation that may include one of the following approaches:  standardized testing, periodic progress report, or dated work  samples. Other methods of assessment, if mutually agreed upon by parents  and school officials, are also allowed.
           </p>
           
           <h3>How often do I need to  send an evaluation? What is my town asks for a mid-year report?</h3>
           
           <em>Charles</em> mentions  &ldquo;periodic progress reports.&rdquo; The period is not specified. However, <em>Charles</em> is  clear that &ldquo;…the approval of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on  requirements that are not essential to the State interest in assuring that all  the children shall be educated.&rdquo; Since many towns accept annual evaluations, a  district would be hard pressed to argue that more frequent reporting is  &ldquo;essential.&rdquo;</p>
           
           <h3>Does my evaluation  need to be &quot;approved&quot;?</h3>
           <p>
           Some districts will say next year's education plan approval depends on  previous year's evaluation. The law sets no bars for an individual's  progress, just that they have progressed.</p>
  
  <h3>If my  town doesn't request an evaluation, do I need to send one?</h3>
  
           <p>Many homeschoolers add a line in their education plan such as, <q>An  annual progress report/dated work sample/standardized test results [parents  pick one] will be submitted upon request.</q> This is a good idea if you  aren&rsquo;t sure whether or not they&rsquo;ll ask for anything; if they don&rsquo;t ask, you  don&rsquo;t need to submit anything. If you know your town consistently requires  people to report, then you may want to submit your report proactively.</p>
  <h3>What should be in a <a href="../../progress_reports.html">progress report</a>?</h3> 
           <p>A progress report may  be a simple list of subjects with progress in each area noted. A very simple <a href="../../sample_progress_report.html">sample progress report</a> is available on the  AHEM website. Your school district may request more  &quot;evidence of progress.” If they do, you can resubmit the report with  additional information.</p>
 
  <h3>How many work samples  do I need to send?</h3>
  <p>
           Dated work samples mean just that: a few samples of work with dates on them.  You do not have to compile an extensive portfolio to submit to the school  although you might like to keep such records for your own use. Many  homeschoolers who use this method choose to send two samples, one from the  beginning and one from the end of the year, in each major subject area (i.e.  language arts, math, science, and social studies).</p>
  
  <h3>What about a <a href="../../portfolios.html">portfolio</a>?</h3>
           <p>Sometimes,  homeschoolers use the word <q>portfolio</q> to refer to the method of  evaluation they use. The word <q>portfolio</q> does not appear in  Massachusetts homeschooling law. Some may use the term to refer  to a collection of dated work samples, but others mean  more, i.e. work samples along with written text that might qualify as a  progress report, for example. Since the term <q>portfolio</q> isn't used in the  law and isn't clearly defined, AHEM recommends avoiding it.</p>
  
  <h3>What if they ask for  more?</h3>
           <p>Some districts may ask  for two forms of evaluation&mdash;work samples with a progress report perhaps&mdash;or midyear evaluations. Some send out conditional approval letters stating  that the education plan approval is conditioned on the submission of extra  forms of evaluation or a specific form not stated in the education plan. The  response to such a letter may be based on various factors including the  homeschooling family's past experience with the district or the school  official's track record with homeschoolers. In many cases, the district will  not press the issue and the homeschooler can simply submit whatever method they  originally stated in their education plan. If a further response is required <strong>AHEM is here to help.</strong>Individual  circumstances play a big role when determining how to respond to requests from  school officials. As always, <a href="../../one-on-one.html">AHEM representatives</a> are available to talk  through options.</p>
         <p><em>This  legal summary was not drafted by practicing lawyers and is not intended to  constitute official legal advice, but rather is presented by AHEM volunteers  and is based on their reading and understanding of Massachusetts homeschooling  requirements as they have followed those requirements throughout the years.  Readers still need to make their own decision on how best to proceed.</em></p>
