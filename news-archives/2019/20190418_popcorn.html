         <h1>Popcorn  and Page Turners: Running a Teen Book Group</h1>
         
         <img src="../../images/bookgroupbooks.jpg" alt=""/>
         <h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
	     <p>When my son, Fred, was 13, we decided to start a book group to read adult  literature. I had never led a book group before—just had read a lot as a  fiction lover—but was excited to give it a try.</p>
         <p>I had a certain framework that I was comfortable with and I was  careful to put this out to prospective members of the group. They were to join  only if they were sincerely interested, not because mom or dad thought it would  be a good idea. I would choose the books, with the readers in mind, of course.  They were committing to doing all the reading, and they weren't to come to book  group (which met on Wednesday afternoons for two hours) unless they had  completed the reading. This applied to my own kid as well. Maybe a risk, as I  might choose a book they didn't really want to read, but it was part of the  package.</p>
         <p>I would read aloud during group, and allow time for questions and  discussions. Kids supplied their own books—sometimes I specified certain  editions depending on a translation or version. I would assign reading for  in-between meetings, usually between 50 and 150 pages. It was important to me  that the kids invested some of their own time into doing the reading, if for no  other reason than that they would have to employ some time management skills in  getting the reading done on time. I always did the assigned reading as well.</p>
         <p>Members of book group rotated bringing a snack to share. This grew  to be a fun part of group, where members would try to one-up each other in the  snack deliciousness factor. I am comfortable with food being eaten in my living  room, so the food was out the whole time, and kids were also welcome to keep  busy while I read aloud, as long as it didn't distract any other listeners.  People knit, drew, Fred even practiced fingering on his guitar. Sometimes  certain sets of kids got a little silly and I'd have to regain their attention.  This was before the days when EVERYONE has a cell phone, so electronic devices  weren't an issue. In a later group I did, kids were texting and receiving  calls, so I had to ask kids to turn off their phones during group. I asked  parents to call only if it was an emergency, and to call the house phone, and  we would hear it and answer if it was for a book group member (yes, sometimes  it was parents who were calling!).</p>
         <p>My goal was to foster a group of kids who, over time, would grow  comfortable asking questions and voicing opinions. To this end, I tried to be a  good listener, and not be didactic in my running of the group. In general I did  not have a goal or moral I wanted the kids to get out of a certain book. In  fact, one of the things I loved most about book group was hearing the kids'  perspectives on different books, and also getting to know these young individuals  better through hearing their opinions and impressions. At the request of one  member, I sometimes <q>quizzed</q> them on the books. I would find a quiz  on Sparknotes or some similar website or book, and ask them the questions,  going around the room. Most of them found this to be fun (they could skip their  turn if they didn't). I found it to be useful in figuring out where maybe  something had missed their understanding, and I could take time to explain. I  always checked in to see that they'd understood the reading done on their own  before piling more on top of it. I would normally try to exhaust what the kids  thought first, with me explaining plot or background if necessary. I think as  time passed, the kids knew that I wasn't trying to shove anything down their  throats or judge them, and then I could be part of the discussion too, but I  tried to wait my turn. I think when adults speak, a lot of times kids hold  their tongues. Sometimes I would get excited about some piece of literary  criticism or some such and share that with them.</p>
         <p>I researched the books before choosing them, figuring out how many  weeks it would likely take to get through each, and how many pages I might  assign. I was usually able to read aloud about 50 pages in two hours. I also  found questions that I thought would provoke discussion or made up my own. How  did I choose the books? I googled <q>college bound reading list</q> and  found several to draw ideas from. Some books I chose because I remembered them  being favorites of mine as a young teen (<em>Frankenstein, Dracula, Wuthering  Heights</em>) or older (<em>One Hundred Years of Solitude, A Confederacy of  Dunces, The Brothers Karamazov, Beloved</em>). Some I chose because they were  classics I had never read myself (<em>Madame Bovary, Things Fall Apart, Mrs.  Dalloway</em>). I tried to choose a variety of genres and time periods. I have  more books left on my list of <q>Want to Reads</q> than I do on the list  of books we read. So many books, so little time.</p>
         <p>We always ended a trimester with a play reading. We read at least  two Shakespeare plays a year. First the kids were assigned to read a Lamb's  Tale or other retelling of a Shakespeare play. Then we would watch a movie  version. The kids would make secret ballots saying what parts they wanted to  read. I would then try to assign parts in a balanced way, pleasing as many  people as possible, and being mindful of not always giving the lead roles to  the same kids. For Shakespeare, people had to read multiple roles, and I read  as well.</p>
         <p>We met from September to June in three sessions. The first went  from September to December with a break over the holidays, the second from  January to March with a couple weeks off, and then from April to June. I did  this for five years with Fred, and for one with my daughter, Nadia (she was in  another similar group for two years before I took it over).</p>
         <p>I inherited Nadia's book group, so I didn't build it from the  beginning. With Fred's, I thought of kids he knew who were of similar ages whom  I thought might be interested and asked them if they'd like to join. There was  no charge to be in the group. I made it clear that we would be reading adult  level literature. I only had so much space in my living room, so the number of  participants was limited to eight or nine. Being at a somewhat similar  intellectual age was important. In general people heard about it by word of  mouth, so if a spot opened, there was usually someone waiting in the wings to  fill it. A couple of times, when a space became available, a younger kid wanted  to try out book group, but unless they could keep up with the content and pace,  they dropped out.</p>
         <p>I did not try to please all the people all the time. Some people  didn't like that they didn't get to pick the books, so my book group wasn't for  them. The way I figured it was I needed to be enjoying myself, and frankly, I  had set the whole thing up to meet my child's needs. I wasn't going to dumb  down reading or choose content based on personal preferences. Sure, some of the  kids were yawning through Persuasion, and I had to agree that Wuthering Heights  had lost some of its luster since I had worshipped it at 12. <em>Beloved</em> was  a struggle for some, and <em>Moby Dick</em> is truly a whale of a book!  But we got through them all, and I don't know that we would have if we hadn't  known Wednesday afternoon was waiting for us, and we wanted to be a part of it,  and being a part of it meant you read or listened to what had been assigned  that week.</p>
         <p>In retrospect, my kids read and enjoyed and absorbed an amazing  array of literature, in itself a wonderful thing. No doubt all that reading  helped them as writers. Fred especially was inspired to go on <q>jags</q> with certain authors he was introduced to—Dickens, Nabokov. Both kids consider  live Shakespeare a treat, and have favorite plays and characters. Both their  college application portfolios boasted an impressive reading list—and not the  annotated or cartoon versions either! I was pleased to hear report that Fred  and others in his group were easily the best-read students in their college  freshman English classes. For my part, it was a pleasure to be able to share my  love of reading with these young people and be part of their growing up,  getting to know them in a different way from just being Fred or Nadia's mom.  But maybe best of all, if I had to pick just one thing, is that I had this  shared experience with my teenagers. Whatever else was going on, we had a  common ground to connect on, to banter over, to commiserate about (Oh  Raskolnikov!). Such a nice thread to have woven through those sometimes  turbulent teen years, and we'll have it forever.</p>
