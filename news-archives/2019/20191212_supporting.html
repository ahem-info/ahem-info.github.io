         <h1>Supporting Each Other</h1>
         <p>Dear Friends,</p>
         <p>Last week I took a helping call from a single mom of three  children. She wanted to know if it were possible to homeschool her 14-year-old  daughter. In our talk—which lasted about 30 minutes—we discussed everything  from the key aspects of the <em><a href="../../charles.html">Charles</a></em> decision to our <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a> to Khan Academy to <em><a href="../../resources.html">The Teenage Liberation Handbook</a></em> to the sled ramp my son had built in our front yard that day. She shared some  of the obstacles she’d overcome in her life and that she felt clueless about  how to homeschool; I spoke of the profound self-doubt I often feel creep in  even after homeschooling for over ten years. As we said goodbye, I told her how  much she inspired me; she wrote down my name and number. I sent her a follow up  email with links to pages on our website and some other resources and told her  to reach out to me again at any time.</p>
         <p>It occurred to me a short while afterward that everything we  do at AHEM was bound up in this exchange, that what we strive for the most is  the establishment of trust. This process often involves surfacing and  addressing the beliefs or misperceptions that hold us back from reporting with  confidence and ease, or connecting meaningfully with fellow homeschoolers, or  supporting our children across the varied and often unpredictable terrain of  their learning. And those kinds of shifts are best facilitated through  communication, one slowed down, authentic conversation at a time.</p>
         <p>AHEM isn&rsquo;t a large corporate entity with a huge support  staff, a multimillion-dollar budget, or a marketing department. It&rsquo;s currently  four people—three board members and two volunteers—who meet once a month around  someone&rsquo;s dining room table, debating our mission and direction (sometimes  heatedly!), divvying up responsibilities, figuring out how we can best serve  you.</p>
         <p>We share a commitment to helping people explore and  strengthen their understanding of homeschool regulation, approach, and benefit.  Sometimes we&rsquo;re not certain of our reach or impact, but we keep showing up with  the faith that the initiatives we work on are helpful in some way, that being a  go-to resource for over fifteen years is what continues to allow homeschoolers  to trust in themselves and each other, in the short term and over the long  haul.</p>
         <p>If you can recall a time when AHEM did this for you, or if  it has in the past and still does, I ask that you consider a year-end <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=MBK78HUEEBXRW&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donation</a> to us. We exist for you and because of you, and a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=MBK78HUEEBXRW&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donation</a>—however small—would enable us to keep going. It would show us that you believe  in us as much as we believe in you. Which, in the end, is what trust actually  looks like.</p>
         <p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=MBK78HUEEBXRW&amp;source=url" target="_blank">Donate securely online</a> or mail a check to AHEM, PO Box 1307, Arlington, MA 02474. Your gift to AHEM is tax-deductible to  the extent allowable by law (and greatly appreciated).</p>
         <p>With gratitude,<br>
         <em>Amy Faeskorn</em><br>
         Volunteer AHEM Board Member since 2015</p>
