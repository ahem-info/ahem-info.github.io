         <h1>AHEM Goes to the MASC/MASS Joint Conference</h1>
         <p>This year AHEM tabled at the <a href="https://www.masc.org/">Massachusetts  Association of School Committees (MASC)</a> and <a href="https://www.massupt.org/">Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents  (MASS)</a> joint conference, where school committee members network with peers  and learn from sessions and exhibitors. MASC is a nonprofit that provides a  range of services to Massachusetts school committees. AHEM became aware of  their policy manual service about 10 years ago. In addition to storing school  policies on their website, they provide sample policies to school committees.</p>
         <p>While it is intended to be helpful, the MASC homeschool  policy IHBG contains several errors or legally questionable requirements. As we  know, <a href="https://www.ahem.info/hs_policies.html">policies are  administrative tools</a> and are not law. If a homeschooler abides by the  guidelines in the <a href="https://www.ahem.info/charles.html"><em>Charles</em></a> decision, they do not need to follow extralegal requests laid out in a school  district&rsquo;s policy, but that disconnect can be stressful. Also, the very same  policy can be executed differently from one town to another, depending on who  is in charge, and it is not uncommon for a policy to say one thing and the  school&rsquo;s homeschool form to say another. All to say, policy itself is not that important, and it was not AHEM&rsquo;s main reason for attending the conference. But  it would be nice if the policy that MASC distributes did adhere to the law, so  we distributed <a href="https://www.ahem.info/sc">handouts</a> which are also  accessible on our website in hopes of educating, and displayed an interactive  &ldquo;policy puzzle&rdquo; to use as a conversation starter.</p>
         <p>Because, conversation. That&rsquo;s really why we went. We wanted  to make connections with the people who have direct oversight of homeschoolers,  to let them know that we are a friendly, reliable resource for them, and hope  that as a result, they will think to turn to us if a question about  homeschooling arises. The biggest takeaway? How much we have in common with  school committee members: Many of them are parents or grandparents who care  about children and community, and who volunteer their time to help. Most were  curious and open to the idea of homeschooling. And some are former or current  homeschooling parents themselves! We came away from our two days at the  conference energized to have made contacts we can follow up with to promote  understanding and positive change in the relationships between homeschoolers  and school committee members.</p>
         <p>School committee members are elected  officials who are in charge of setting homeschool policy. If a problem arises  around policy or its implementation, they may be your most valuable allies. You  might consider being proactive by creating a connection with one or more of  them before a need arises—arrange a meeting with several local families in the  local library, or meet over coffee. <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info?subject=Please%20send%20info%20for%20school%20committee">AHEM can supply you with informational  homeschooling-in-Massachusetts packets</a> if you would find that helpful, but the real value in meeting  face-to-face will be in demystifying homeschooling. Let&rsquo;s be open minded and give  each other the benefit of the doubt. Your efforts on a local scale are likely  to be more rewarding in ways big and small than AHEM&rsquo;s move to bridge the gap.  Let&rsquo;s keep the momentum going!</p>
