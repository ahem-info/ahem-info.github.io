			  <h1>Announcing AHEM Networking Forum</h1>
              <p>AHEM  listened and heard the challenges independent family-based homeschooling  families face these days. Elists have fizzled, Facebook is an unreliable source  for finding out about events, many groups seem splintered or private. Where do  you fit in? Is it worth going to the park if you&rsquo;re not sure anyone else will  show up? How can you meet other homeschoolers who live nearby? You are not  alone. This is a refrain we have heard a lot in our talks with Massachusetts  homeschoolers.</p>
                <p>In his book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2wf7qGe">Palaces for the People</a>,</em> Eric  Klinenberg points out that, “Building real connections requires a shared  physical environment—a social infrastructure.” For many years, social  infrastructure for independent family-based homeschoolers meant support group get-togethers  like regular park days and library hangouts. This infrastructure is now glaring  in its absence, having been replaced by drop-off classes and social media. While  social media serves a function, in some ways it has contributed to fracturing the  backbone of independent homeschooling: large, active,  inclusive support groups.</p>
                <p>The kind of  free-form, do-it-yourself get-togethers that used to provide the infrastructure  for homeschooling families allowed &ldquo;sustained, recurrent interaction&rdquo; which is  what humans of all ages need in order to forge bonds and grow relationships.  Homeschoolers are notoriously independent-minded—we&rsquo;ve got to be to strike out  on what is still a fringe lifestyle choice. That independence can be an added  challenge to fostering real world communities that require commitment and &ldquo;searching  for commonalities in those who are different and for humanity in those who  disagree with us.&rdquo; Especially when all we might have in common is that our kid  is not in school. But these opportunities for sustained, recurrent interaction are also vital to nurturing a family&rsquo;s  homeschooling lifestyle. Children of course need the opportunity for  unstructured social play, but parents also benefit from connection. </p>
          <p>At a recent <a href="https://houghtonspondparkday.home.blog/">Houghton’s Pond Park Day</a> gathering a group of parents discussed the challenges  and rewards that come with nurturing this kind of social infrastructure (among  them getting introverts to commit to a regular group activity—challenging--and  reaching a comfort level with watching each other’s kids—rewarding!). They  noted the importance of building time in on either side of scheduled  activities, be they park days, classes, or field trips, so that connection can  continue. And one of the parents, Donald, had an insight that dovetails with  AHEM’s next big idea: That while for many years support groups were the way  that homeschoolers organized themselves, led by volunteers planning regular  activities and get-togethers, now “events” create the framework for potential  social infrastructure, where various subsets and smaller groups overlap and  intersect, either on a one time or recurring basis. It’s more challenging and  messier, but the possibility for connection still exists if you prioritize it.</p>
          <p>But, it can  be hard to prioritize this kind of activity when you don’t know where or when  it’s happening. Sherry Turkle’s book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Et1DS2">Reclaiming  Conversation</a></em> calls for a focus on the people and places in front of us and  to use communications technologies to direct us to physical places that  everyone can access. In an attempt to harness the power of technology in service of connection, the new AHEM website  describes the  guidelines for the AHEM Networking Forum and Calendar to facilitate families in  different parts of Massachusetts to meet in person repeatedly and get to know  each other.
