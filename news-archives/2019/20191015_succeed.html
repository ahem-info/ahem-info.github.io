         <h1><q>How to Help Your Child Succeed at School</q></h1>
         <p>By Sophia Sayigh</p>
         <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/help-your-child-succeed-at-school" target="_blank">title</a> in the Smarter Living section of <em>The New York Times</em> caught my eye. Hmph. If schools are supposedly for the benefit of children, why  do parents need to help their kids <q>succeed</q>? </p>
         <p><strong>And what is success in school anyway?</strong> According to the article: <q>A successful experience in school is  not only about report cards. [OK—so it IS about report cards…] Ideally your  child will learn how to learn, retain information, think independently, ask  questions and develop an increasing sense of competence.</q> Ideally?? Obviously,  children already know <q>how to learn</q> before they go to school. Children are  also able to <q>retain information</q> before going to school, as well as think  independently and ask questions, but apparently they are at risk of graduating  without these skills and attributes if their school experience is less than <q>ideal.</q>  Schools actually unteach <q>how to learn</q> and <q>retaining information</q> and so on—hence the need for parents to help the  children <q>succeed.</q> That puts a lot of pressure on parents to wring something  good out of the experience for their kids, and lays the responsibility for  school <q>success</q> on the children and parents rather than the schools, but I  digress.</p>
         <p>The need for yardsticks to measure the accountability of public  schools results in an institution that is not designed to benefit children. Schools  need everyone to fit in the same shape hole, but children come in all different  shapes. In school children are expected to sit still, obey authority, and  perform tasks as directed to get good grades (aka to <q>succeed</q>). Whatever shape  your child is, whether they fit nicely in the school shaped hole or not, the  need for schools to adhere to certain set standards and evaluations sets up a  zero sum game for kids. If your child isn&rsquo;t one of the winners, they will be  one of the losers. And even the <q>winners</q> might be losers, if becoming a winner  means shaving off some of those individualistic rough edges to fit into the school  shaped hole, or failing to encourage other parts of oneself to flourish because  the school shape fit so nicely to begin with. School trains children to figure  out how to succeed in school (or not), not in the world at large, all the while  draining children&rsquo;s natural abilities and desires to learn, retain information,  ask questions, be creative, and pursue subjects and activities that interest  them.</p>
         <p><strong>What does all this have to do with homeschooling?</strong> The article&rsquo;s tips to circumvent the debilitating effects  school has on children&rsquo;s natural abilities, are easily woven into homeschooling  life if you can resist trying to replicate school at home. Here&rsquo;s why: By  choosing to homeschool, you and your child get to define what success means to  you. And the definition can be different for every single individual in a  family. When you homeschool, you have at your disposal the whole wide world,  from your backyard to international travel. Also, the <q>ideal</q> goals the article  presents can be your actual goals when you homeschool. As a parent, one of your  main goals is to do no harm to your child&rsquo;s natural abilities, while contortions  and strategizing are needed to lessen the harm school does so that children  have a hope of retaining the skills they arrived with. </p>
         <p>Here are some of the article&rsquo;s suggested strategies for parents:</p>
         <ul>
           <li><strong><q>Focus on the  process, not the product; value goals over grades; maintain a long-term  perspective.</q></strong> For a homeschooling  child, grades and evaluation can be irrelevant and nonexistent. Homeschoolers  don&rsquo;t have to look at the world parsed by subjects and judgment. The <q>process</q>  can last for days (or years) at a time, or be abandoned when a rest is needed.  Many times the <q>product</q> is different than first intended, and other times a  discovery is serendipitous. Learning at home and in the world doesn&rsquo;t have to  be a straight line with a set goal in mind. As the famous inventor and  homeschooler Thomas Edison said, <q>I have not failed. I've just found  10,000 ways that won't work.</q></li>
           <li><strong><q>Help kids create effective  good routines… Kids are more  likely to stick with a plan they created themselves.</q></strong> When homeschooling,  we can take that a step further: Kids are more likely to stick with a plan they  created themselves to accomplish something they are motivated to do for their  own reasons. (Aren&rsquo;t you?) Hence, lessons they learn about good routines and good  studying or practice habits are lessons that are learned at a deep level and  retained in pursuit of something important to them. By the time homeschoolers  enter college or the workplace, time management is a skill they have honed in  the context of real world relationships they value with friends, colleagues, family  members, mentors, and teachers in their communities, bearing real lessons with  meaningful feedback and consequences.</li>
           <li><strong>Work with their  bodies, not against them:</strong> Basically, this whole  section in the article is just about ensuring kids get enough sleep.  Homeschoolers have got this down.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Modeling is a recurring theme in the article, mentioned as a way  of teaching your kids a good work ethic, asking for help, asserting yourself, challenging  yourself. Modeling is one of the most powerful tools in a homeschooling  parent&rsquo;s toolbox. In addition to the aforementioned, you can model pursuing  your interests, reading, helping others, treating others with kindness, or whatever  you value. Your kids are watching and listening and they want to learn from  you. </p>
         <p>While you&rsquo;re living in rhythm with your children, you nurture  your child&rsquo;s strengths and discover who they are as people. My bet is,  especially if you yourself went to school, you will learn more from your  children than you ever teach them, and they will learn more than could ever be  measured by a report card, or captured in a progress report for that matter! </p>
