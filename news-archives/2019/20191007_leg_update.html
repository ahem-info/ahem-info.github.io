         <h1>Legislative Update - October 2019</h1>
         
         <p>Our Massachusetts Legislature began its 191^st session on  January 2, 2019. Below is a summary of bills filed this session that AHEM is  following. At this time no action needs to be taken on any of these bills.</p>
         <h2>Bills concerning MCAS</h2>
         
         <h4>H.504 AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS  TO THE MCAS EXAM Bradley H. Jones, Jr.</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
		   <li>1/22/2019 Referred to the committee on Education</li>
         <li>1/22/2019 Senate concurred</li>
         <li>6/17/2019 Joint Hearing</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary,  the department of elementary and secondary education shall issue a report on  the feasibility and costs associated with non-public school students and home  schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily taking the Massachusetts  Comprehensive Assessment System exam; provided that said report shall be  provided to the secretary of administration and finance, the commissioner of  elementary and secondary education, and the clerks of the senate and house of  representatives who shall forward the same to the chair of the senate ways and  means committee, the chair of the house ways and means committee, and the house  and senate chairs of the joint committee on education within 6 months of the  effective date of this act.</p>
         <p><em>Summary: Would issue a report on allowing private and  homeschooled students to take the MCAS. AHEM contacted Rep. Jones and asked  that “and home schooled students” be removed from the language of the bill, as  homeschoolers are included in the category “non-public school students.”</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM&rsquo;s position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
         
		   <h4>H.570 AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS  TO THE MCAS EXAM Alan Silvia</h4>
         <ul class="nested">

         <li>1/22/2019 Senate concurred</li>
  <li>6/17/2019 Joint Hearing</li>

         <p>SECTION 1. The department of elementary and secondary education  shall issue a report on the feasibility and costs associated with non-public  school students and home schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily taking the  Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exam; provided that said report  shall be provided to the secretary of administration and finance, the  commissioner of elementary and secondary education, and the clerks of the  senate and house of representatives who shall forward the same to the chair of  the senate ways and means committee, the chair of the house ways and means  committee, and the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on education  within 6 months of the effective date of this act.</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: Would issue a report on allowing private and  homeschooled students to take the MCAS.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM&rsquo;s position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
         
         <h2>Bills raising the mandatory attendance age</h2>
         
         <h4>S.241 AN ACT RELATIVE TO DROPOUT PREVENTION AND  RE-ENGAGEMENT Sonia Chang-Diaz</h4>

         <p><em>Summary: Raises the compulsory attendance age from 16 to  18.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: Opposed.</em></p>
         
         <h4>H.416 AN ACT TO REQUIRE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE UP TO AGE  EIGHTEEN OR UNTIL GRADUATION Antonio F. D. Cabral</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
         <li>1/22/2019 Referred to the committee on Education</li>
         <li>1/22/2019 Senate concurred</li>
         <li>6/25/2019 Joint Hearing</li>
         </ul>
         <p>SECTION 1. Section 1 of chapter 76 of the General Laws,  as appearing in the 2016 Official Edition, is hereby amended by—</p>
         <p>(a) striking out, in lines 1 to 2, the words &ldquo;between the  minimum and maximum ages established for school attendance by the board of  education&rdquo; and inserting in place thereof the following words:- &ldquo;ages of 6 and  18, having completed at least the twelfth grade or whichever comes first&rdquo;.; and</p>
         <p>(b) inserting after the word &ldquo;herewith&rdquo;, in line 58, the  following words:- &ldquo;, provided that no student over the age of 16 shall face  criminal penalties for failure to attend school through the mandatory age for  school attendance&rdquo;.</p>
         <p>SECTION 2. Section 1B of chapter 69 of the General Laws,  as appearing in the 2016 Official Edition is hereby amended by inserting before  the period, in line 120, the following words:- &ldquo;, provided, however, that all  children under the age of 18 shall be required to attend school if they have  not graduated from high school&rdquo;.</p>
        
         <p><em>Summary: Raises the compulsory attendance age from 16 to  18.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: Opposed.</em></p>
         
         <h2>Bill regarding community college tuition</h2>
         
         <h4>S.1089 AN ACT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION Eric P. Lesser</h4>
         <ul class="nested">
         <li>1/22/2019 Senate Referred to the committee on Labor and  Workforce Development</li>
         <li>1/22/2019 House concurred</li>
         <li>4/4/2019 Senate Discharged to the committee on Higher  Education</li>
         <li>4/8/2019 House concurred</li>
         <li>7/23/19 Joint Hearing</li>
         </ul>
         <p>(1) To be eligible for the scholarship a student shall be  admitted to, and enrolled full-time in, an eligible postsecondary program  within five years following graduation, not including time spent in the United  States Armed Forces, from an eligible high school in Massachusetts, or  completion of high school as a Massachusetts home school student, or obtaining  a GED® or HiSET® diploma.</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: This bill would create the Massachusetts Workforce  Opportunity Scholarship. The problem with it is that it introduces the term  &ldquo;home school&rdquo; into law, and would require defining what qualifies as completion  of high school. AHEM&rsquo;s thought is that it would be less confusing to simply  allow students to be eligible until a certain age, say 23, not including time  spent in the armed forces. AHEM has contacted Sen. Lesser&rsquo;s office with this  suggestion, but is not confident they understand our concern.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: Neutral, if language is changed.</em></p>
         
         <h2>Bills regarding vaccination</h2>
        
         <h4>S.2359 AN ACT PROMOTING COMMUNITY IMMUNITY Rebecca L. Rausch</h4>
		   <h4>H.4096 AN ACT PROMOTING COMMUNITY IMMUNITY Paul J. Donato, Rebecca L. Rausch</h4>
		   <ul class="nested">
		   <li>Both bills were referred to the Joint  Committee on Public Health in late September</li>
         </ul>
         <p>(b) As used in this section, the following words shall  have the following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:-  &ldquo;Covered program&rdquo;, (i) a child care center, as defined in section 1A of chapter  15D; (ii) a school, whether public, private or charter, that provides education  to students in any combination of grade levels from kindergarten to grade 12,  inclusive, and including, but not limited to, any school activity open to  children who are home schooled; (iii) a recreational camp; or (iv) an  institution of higher education, whether public or private.</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: Repeals Section 15 of Chapter 76 and replaces it  with the Community Immunity Act. AHEM takes no position on vaccination. AHEM contacted  Rep. Donato&rsquo;s and Sen. Rausch&rsquo;s offices and asked that &ldquo;home schooled&rdquo; be  changed to &ldquo;otherwise instructed&rdquo; to match statutory language in Chapter 76  Section 1, because we object to introducing the term &ldquo;home schooled&rdquo; into  statutory language, as doing so begs its definition. The suggestion was  appreciated by both representatives and will be   forwarded to legal counsel.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
