         <h1>The Value of Homeschooling</h1>
         <h4>By Erin Matica</h4>
         <p>We live in a culture that often doesn&rsquo;t value what matters  most. How many times have I been to a party and when people ask what I <q>do</q> they are less than impressed with the answer when I say <q>I&rsquo;m a homeschooling  mother</q>? Last winter when my dad died my eldest brother and I went to take care  of some financial issues regarding my dad&rsquo;s estate. As the banker was filling  out the paperwork he asked what I <q>did.</q> When I replied that I was a  homeschooling mother and homesteader he said, <q>Oh. OK, unemployed.</q> I said,  <q>No, I have a very important job, I just don&rsquo;t get paid for it.</q></p>
         <p>What has happened to us as a society when our only value  lies in what we are contributing to the GDP? Luckily such dismissive comments  about me being <q>just</q> a stay-at-home mom cannot hurt me. Sure, I feel  disrespected and angry when I&rsquo;m spoken to this way, but my self-esteem is never  in jeopardy. We have wonderfully supportive family and friends and my husband  tells me that I have the harder and more important job. Even more so, I know in  my heart that my time and energy has been well spent. Our five children (ages  14 – 24) have grown into some of the best people I know. To the extent that  they are happy and thriving and successful at being wonderful human beings, we  owe much of that to the care and attention we spent on natural parenting and  unschooling when they were younger.</p>
         <p>What price can we put on happy children? What value would  you give to happy, responsible, productive, caring, extraordinary people? Most  of the homeschooled kids that we know have a certain immunity to many of  society&rsquo;s worst ills. No person or family is perfect of course, but it is an  encouraging thought that what we are doing is in some ways a protective measure,  and that our kids will be able to weather life&rsquo;s storms in constructive,  non-self-destructive ways.</p>
         <p>To all of you homeschooling parents, grandparents, and  supportive friends and family, please know that what you are doing is making a  positive difference in the lives of your children now and in the future.  Homeschooling matters. Your time, care, and attention matter immeasurably.  Never be ashamed that you are <q>just</q> a homeschooling parent. Whether you are a  stay-at-home parent or work full-time, raising and helping our children learn  will always be our most important work.</p>
