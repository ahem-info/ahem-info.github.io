         <h1>AHEM&rsquo;s Policy and Practice Data Analysis - July 2019</h1>
         <p>For over fifteen  years, AHEM has been <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HSGC3N2">collecting information from homeschoolers</a> about official  town policy (including the policies themselves), and about how interfacing with  school officials works in practice in towns in Massachusetts, according to  homeschoolers.</p>
         <p>While overall the  response totals are not large enough to be statistically significant, when we  are helping individual homeschoolers we can quickly refer to the database and  see how other homeschoolers in a town report their experiences. The responses also  serve to give us a snapshot of homeschooling policy and practice trends over time  among those who report. Reasons YOU should fill out the survey (less than 10  minutes) no matter what your experience is. Do it once a year, just like your  taxes! &#128522; </p>
         
         <p>Below are some charts  and graphs that give you a picture of questionnaire responses over three years:  2016, 2017, and 2018. Where a percentage is given, it is the three year  average.  </p>
         
         <h3>When do school officials ask that you submit homeschooling  plans?</h3>
         <p>33% of schools don&rsquo;t specify. In towns where  there is a requested date of submission, there were no reports of problems if a  plan was filed later than requested. From the survey:</p>
         
         <blockquote><em><q>I usually send my info in on time,  but I have been late occasionally and there were no consequences.</q></em></blockquote>
       <img src="../../images/when_submit.png" alt="When do school officials ask that you submit an education plan?"/> 
	   <h3>Regarding  face-to-face meetings</h3>
       <p>69% of respondents  report that school officials do not ask for face-to-face meetings.&nbsp;Of  those asked to meet,&nbsp;45% choose to comply, and&nbsp;55% do not. Usually  declining a meeting is as simple as saying <q>No, thank you,</q> or even ignoring  the request. Homeschoolers&nbsp;who chose not to meet with school officials  were ultimately approved. From the survey:</p>
       
       <blockquote><em><q>I simply declined to  address the request when I submitted my plan.</q></em></blockquote>
       <img src="../../images/meetings.png" alt="Regarding face-to-face meetings"/> 
	 <h3>Hours and schedules</h3>
<p>Most respondents are asked to state that they meet or exceed the 900/990 hours required yearly in the public schools or aren’t asked for anything.</p>
 
<p>If asked to supply a schedule, it often suffices to state instead that you will meet or exceed, or provide the equivalent of, the 900/990 hours of instruction in the public schools, or to ignore the request. In any case, there were no negative consequences for those who chose to decline giving a grid type schedule. From the survey:</p>

<blockquote><em>“They asked for a weekly schedule and hours by subject—again we ignored this request and quoted Brunelle (the parts you guys have on the AHEM site) and we got approved.”</em></blockquote>
<img src="../../images/hours.png" alt="Hours and schedules"/> 
	 <h3>Access to materials</h3>
<p>74% of respondents provide a list or partial list of materials and/or resources.</p>
<img src="../../images/materials.png" alt="Access to materials"/> 
	 <h3>Parental qualifications:</h3>
     <p>38% of respondents summarize their  educational background. 36% say only that they are <q>of competent ability  and good morals.</q></p>
       <img src="../../images/parental_qual.png" alt="Parental qualifications"/> 
	   <h3>Form  of assessment:</h3>
		   <ul class="nested">
       <li>54.2% of respondents write a progress report.</li>
       <li>14% of respondents submit work samples.</li>
       <li>10% of respondents submit no evaluation at all.</li>
       <li>5.0% of respondents choose to test.</li>
       <li>Some respondents  indicated their evaluation method varies; parents choose from year to year. A  few indicated use of a form of evaluation other than testing, progress reports,  or work samples.</li>
		   </ul>
       <img src="../../images/assessment.png" alt=""/> 
	   <h3>Frequency of assessment:</h3>
       <p>73% of respondents  who indicated frequency submit evaluation once a year. From the survey:</p>
       
       <blockquote><em><q>They ask for quarterly, we provide annual at the same time  as we submit education plan. All get sent right before start of school. They  send letter saying they accept and ask for quarterly, we ignore and never hear  from them. So it has all been going for 10 years now, so it&rsquo;s good.</q></em></blockquote>
       <img src="../../images/assessment_freq.png" alt="How many times a year?"/> 
	     <h3>Approval  or acknowledgement letters:</h3>
          <p>70% of respondents always receive an approval or acknowledgement letter.</p>
       <img src="../../images/letter.png" alt="Approval or acknowledgemnt letters"/> 
	     <h3>Do  school officials allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities?</h3>
          <p>8.0% of respondents  report that their school does not allow them to participate in school functions  at all. Varying percentages of respondents report that their school allows them  to participate in either classes, sports, extracurricular activities, chorus or  band, borrowing books, or some combination of these. Most respondents don&rsquo;t  know what their town&rsquo;s policy or practice is.</p>
       <img src="../../images/Activities.png" alt="Activities"/> 
		   <h3>Which best describes your district?</h3>
		   <p>This question asks about subjective experience. The exact same treatment in the same town can be described by one homeschooler as “nice and easy” and by another as “a pain in the you-know-what.” Knowing what the law allows is the best way to judge whether what your town is asking of you is reasonable or not. <a href="../../faq.html">So read up!</a></p>
		   <blockquote><em>“I am grateful for the guidance I received from other homeschooling families and from AHEM in my early days because when I put my materials together for the school I was informed about what I did and did not have to include. I held to the legal standard and the school district has respected that. It is so critically important for people to be informed when they communicate with the district…”</em></blockquote>
       <img src="../../images/description.png" alt="Three Year Average"/> 
	   <p>And while social media can amplify hotspots  where people are experiencing difficulty, tools like our questionnaire help  show that in practice, the ease of working with school officials and getting plans  approved in Massachusetts is actually remaining steady or even improving. We at  AHEM would like to think this is due to an educated and empowered population of  homeschoolers: YOU!</p>
       
       <p>In summary, things continue to go pretty  smoothly for homeschoolers in Massachusetts. Most homeschoolers report no  difficulties in dealing with school officials. In cases where school officials  ask for more than <em>Charles</em> allows, we see over and over again that  homeschoolers who are aware of their rights simply submit what <em>Charles</em> allows, and everything works out. Furthermore, standing up for your  rights in this way strengthens the ability of other homeschoolers to  do the same, and lessens the likelihood that school officials&rsquo; demands will  escalate. </p>
       
       <p>We can&rsquo;t say it enough: <a href="../../hs_policies.html">School policies are  not law.</a> School policies that exceed <em>Charles</em> and <em>Brunelle</em> do not  have to be adhered to by homeschoolers. From the survey:</p>
       
       <blockquote><em>I used to give  them all the info they wanted. Now I know better.</em></blockquote>
       <p>See <em><a href="../../tips.html">Tips for Writing your Education Plan</a></em> for  ways to satisfy the requirements of <em>Charles</em> without going into needless  detail.</p>

       <p>This is an ongoing project: We hope you will  help us build the database further as the more responses we get, the clearer  the picture of homeschooling in Massachusetts becomes. The more questionnaire  responses we receive, the easier it is for us to pinpoint hotspots or identify  trends. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=lwP373yb5gBQFElJgDNE7A_3d_3d">Please take a few minutes to fill out the questionnaire.</a></p>
