<h1>Homeschooling Teens: The World Is Your Oyster</h1>
	<p>Homeschooling high school is great preparation for life  after homeschooling, helping to hone dreams and skills to attain what you want.  You get to live your life now, not just &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; for the future. It allows  for:</p>		
	<ul class="nested">	   
	        <li>Time and  space to explore and delve into interests</li>
	  		<li>Real world  experience</li>
	  		<li>Self-paced  study (faster or slower)</li>
	  		<li>Flexible  scheduling</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>What about socializing?</h3>
	  <p>The norm in our culture is school, which means having a set  group of peers with whom you spend all day, every day. In the real world,  that&rsquo;s not how people meet and make friends. They do meet people and make  friends though, in various settings. Just because you are a high school aged  homeschooler, doesn&rsquo;t mean all your friends have to be high school aged  homeschoolers.</p>
	  <p>According to psychologist and friendship expert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/well/live/how-to-make-friends-adult.html" target="_blank">Marisa  Franco</a> some strategies for making friends at any age include:</p>
		  <ul class="nested">
		  	<li>Assume  people like you</li>
	  		<li>Join  something that meets regularly over time</li>
	  		<li>Show  people that you like and value them</li>
		  </ul>
	  <h3>Join an established group in your community to meet new  people:</h3>
	  	<ul class="nested">
		   <li>Camps,  Scouts, 4H, SPLASH</li>
	  		<li>Volunteering  and employment</li>
	  		<li>Community  groups or organizations related to your interests</li>
	  		<li>Community  education and community college classes</li>
	  	</ul>
	<h3>Create your own opportunities to meet people through shared  interests</h3>
	  	<p>Proactively creating opportunities to pursue interests and  meet people is a skill that will serve you well throughout life. Here are some  ideas to get your juices flowing. What excites you? Start there.</p>
	  <h4>Actor?</h4>
		<ul class="nested">
	  	<li>Gather to  play theater games or read parts out loud</li>
	  	<li>Join a  community theater group</li>
	  	<li>Go see  live productions—volunteers may be needed for tech and wardrobe too</li>
	  	<li>Invite  others over to work your way through a Top 100 Movies list, or go to the cinema</li>
			</ul>
	  <h4>Artist?</h4>
	<ul class="nested">
	  	<li>Look for  fellow artists to share talents and swap ideas</li>
	  	<li>Explore  museums, art galleries, graffiti walls</li>
	  	<li>Take a  class in pottery, drawing, painting, glass blowing, photography—you name it</li>
		</ul>
	  <h4>Athlete?</h4>
	<ul class="nested">
	  <li>Meet at a  park or field to play a pickup game of soccer, softball, Ultimate Frisbee,  whatever!</li>
	  <li>Gather at  a skating rink—check out your town&rsquo;s recreation department offerings</li>
	  <li>Explore a  bike trail</li>
	</ul>
	  <h4>Bibliophile?</h4>
	  <p>Pick a book, a date in the future, and a place to meet. Get  together. Discuss. Snacks required!</p>
	  <h4>Crafter?</h4>
	  <p>Invite crafters to sit, talk, learn from each other, and  admire each other&rsquo;s creations.</p>
	  <h4>Foodie?</h4>
	<ul class="nested">
	  <li>Host a  potluck, themed or not</li>
	  <li>Explore local  restaurants</li>
	  <li>Have a  cookie swap</li>
	  <li>Start a  cookbook club</li>
	</ul>  
	<h4>Gamer?</h4>
	  <p>Get together to focus on a particular game like chess,  Scrabble, Magic, or D&amp;D or just ask attendees to bring their favorite card  or board games to share.</p>
	  <h4>Music lover?</h4>
	<ul class="nested">
	  <li>Organize a  folk, classical, jazz, or rock ensemble</li>
	  <li>Get  together to sing folk songs, rounds, or other simple fun songs</li>
	  <li>Attend  live music events together, from symphonies to open mics</li>
	  <li>Join a  chorus</li>
	</ul>
	  <h4>Naturalist?</h4>
	  
	<p>Organize hikes to explore outside. This can go in a lot of  different directions: You can incorporate animal tracking, discover edible  plants, whittling, bird watching, forest bathing... or not!</p>
	<h4>Writer?</h4>
	  <p>Get together to write, using prompts or working on your own  story. Share or not!</p>
	  <h3>Keep in Mind</h3>
	  <p>Most of these ideas are low cost or free. For each one you  can:</p>
	<ul class="nested">
	  <li>make it a  one-time meeting, or a series</li>
	  <li>have the  same person host each time, or rotate, or meet in a community space</li>
	  <li>ask people  to RSVP or wing it</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Don&rsquo;t be discouraged if turnout is low. Sometimes fewer people  means it&rsquo;s easier to get to know each other.</p>
	  <p>In addition to whatever social networking platforms you have  at your disposal, AHEM has resources to help you connect with others:</p>
	<ul class="nested">
	  <li>The <a href="../../forum.html">AHEM  Forum</a> where you can post your own ideas</li>
	  <li><a href="../../networking.html">A listing  of local support groups</a></li>
	  <li><a href="../../tpp.html">Town Point  People </a>to find other homeschoolers in your town</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Good luck!</p>
