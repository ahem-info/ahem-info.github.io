         <h1>Library Love Letter</h1>
		   <h4>By Sophia Sayigh</h4>
                           <p>I          used to gather weekly with a group of pre-teen homeschooled boys at a          table in the local public library for the editorial board meeting of          their quarterly magazine, <em>Dr.          Information</em>. <em>Dr.          Information</em> featured a regular column called <q>Dr. Information Prescribes.</q> The boys came up with a topic, be it books,          games, movies, music or places to go, and they brainstormed some of          their favorites to list. One issue's topic was <q>Destinations</q> and in          the midst of various fun spots such as local ski resorts, amusement          parks, and bowling alleys, I heard a loud suggestion of <q>Robbins          Library,</q> followed by a chorus of agreement. No sarcasm here: the local          public library was truly one of their favorite destinations.</p>
                           <p>Twenty years later, public libraries,          adept at changing with the times to meet local community needs, remain          gold mines for families engaged in home-based education. </p>
                           <p>AHEM          surveyed homeschoolers to see what they most want from libraries, and          found that most of what they desire, many libraries already offer:</p>
                           <ul class="nested">
                             <li>Books about               homeschooling and educational philosophy (suggestions for a core               collection <a href="../../resources.html">here</a>) </li>
                             <li><a href="../../outreach.html">Presentations</a> about homeschooling               in Massachusetts and homeschooling high school</li>
                             <li>A <q>Library of               Things</q> that circulates items such as math manipulatives,               science kits, microscope and slides, telescope, board games,               tools, musical instruments (one example <a href="https://www.robbinslibrary.org/collections/kids-diy/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
                             <li>Foreign language               resources such as <a href="https://mangolanguages.com/" target="_blank">Mango</a> or <a href="https://www.rosettastone.com/" target="_blank">Rosetta Stone</a></li>
                             <li>Math, literature, and               historical fiction lists</li>
                             <li>Unit study kits and               curriculum units on specific topics</li>
                             <li>Extended borrowing               privileges, like many school teachers have</li>
                             <li>Daytime programs and               opportunities for six- to fifteen-year-olds. Ideas include               workshops in library research techniques, librarian-led children's               or parent/child book group, and social events for families</li>
                             <li>Networking               opportunities for parents</li>
                             <li>Discounted passes to               local museums</li>
                             <li>Free meeting space for               all kinds of homeschooler organized events–meetings, rehearsal               space, regularly scheduled board game and craft days, and events               such as science and history fairs and talent shows</li>
                             <li>Links to current               information on state laws and regulations regarding homeschooling               i.e. <a href="../../index.html">www.AHEM.info</a>!</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>If          your local library doesn&rsquo;t offer something that you&rsquo;d like to see, talk          to a Children's or Reference librarian.</p>
                             <p>
                             AHEM has <a href="../../documents/considering_homeschooling.pdf"><em>Considering          Homeschooling</em></a> brochures that you can offer to a          librarian, while introducing yourself as a local homeschooler. Want a          few? Just ask! And then let your librarian know what you love about the          library, and how the library can make you love it even more.</p>
