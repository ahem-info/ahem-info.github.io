         <h1>Frequently Asked Questions: End-of-Year Evaluations</h1>
           <p>It’s that time of year. Many of us are finishing up one  school year and thinking about reporting for the next. Whether this is your  first year reporting or you are an experienced homeschooler, AHEM has answers  to all your evaluation questions. For more on each of these topics, please  visit <a href="../../methods_eval.html">our website</a>.</p>
         <h3>What forms of evaluation are acceptable?</h3>
          <p> <a href="../../charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others,</em> 399  Mass. 324 (1987)</a> says that school  officials and parents should agree on a method of evaluation that may include  one of the following approaches: standardized testing, periodic progress  report, or dated work samples. Other methods of assessment, if mutually agreed  upon by parents and school officials, are also allowed.</p>
         <h3>How often do I need to send an evaluation? What if my town  asks for a mid-year report? </h3>
         <p><em>Charles</em> mentions <q>periodic progress reports.</q> The  period is not specified. However, <em>Charles</em> is clear that <q>…the approval  of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on requirements that are not  essential to the State interest in assuring that all the children shall be  educated.</q> Since many towns accept annual evaluations, a district would be hard  pressed to argue that more frequent reporting is <q>essential.</q> </p>
	 <h3>Does my evaluation need to be <q>approved</q>?</h3>
         <p>Some districts will say next year&rsquo;s education plan approval  depends on previous year&rsquo;s evaluation. The law gives no bars for an  individual's progress, just that they have progressed.</p>
         <h3>If my town doesn&rsquo;t request an evaluation, do I need to send  one?</h3>
         <p>Many homeschoolers add a line in their education plan such  as, <q>An annual progress report/dated work sample/standardized test results [parents  pick one] will be submitted upon request.</q> This is a good idea if you aren&rsquo;t  sure whether they&rsquo;ll ask for anything: if they don&rsquo;t ask, you don&rsquo;t need to  submit anything. If you know your town consistently requires people to report,  then you may want to submit your report proactively.</p>
	<h3>What should be in a progress report?</h3>
           <p>A <a href="../../progress_reports.html">progress report </a>may be a simple list of subjects with  progress in each area noted. A very simple <a href="../../sample_progress_report.html">sample progress report</a> is available  on the AHEM website.  Your school  district may request more <q>evidence of progress.</q> If they do, you can  resubmit the report with additional information.</p>
	<h3>How many work samples do I need to send?</h3>
         <p>Dated work samples mean just that: a few samples of work  with dates on them. You do not have to compile an extensive portfolio to submit  to the school although you might like to keep such records for your own use.  Many homeschoolers who use this method choose to send two samples, one from the  beginning and one from the end of the year, in each major subject area (i.e.  language arts, math, science, and social studies). </p>
         <h3>What about a portfolio?</h3>
           <p>Sometimes, homeschoolers use the word <a href="../../portfolios.html">“portfolio”</a> to refer to  the method of evaluation they use. The word portfolio does not appear in  Massachusetts homeschooling law. Some may use the term to refer to a collection  of dated work samples, but others mean more—work samples along with  written text that might qualify as a progress report, for example. Since the  term portfolio isn’t used in the law and isn’t clearly defined, AHEM recommends  avoiding it. </p>
           <h3>What if they ask for more?</h3>
          <p> Some districts may ask for two forms of evaluation—work  samples with a progress report perhaps—or midyear evaluations. Some send out  conditional approval letters stating that the education plan approval is  conditioned on the submission of extra forms of evaluation, or a specific form  not stated in the education plan. The response to such a letter may be based on  various factors including the homeschooling family's past experience with the  district or the school official’s track record with homeschoolers. In many  cases, the district will not press the issue and the homeschooler can simply  submit whatever method they originally stated in their education plan. If a  further response is required AHEM is here to help. Individual circumstances  play a big role when determining how to respond to requests from school  officials. As always, <a href="../../one-on-one.html">AHEM representatives</a> are available to talk through  options.</p>
 <p> <em>This legal summary was not drafted by practicing lawyers  and is not intended to constitute official legal advice, but rather is  presented by AHEM volunteers and is based on their reading and understanding of  Massachusetts homeschooling requirements as they have followed those  requirements throughout the years. Readers still need to make their own  decision on how best to proceed.</em></p>
