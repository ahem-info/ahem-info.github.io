          <h1>Help Getting Started Homeschooling </h1>
		   <p>Whether          you are starting in August or jumping in mid-year, the AHEM website has          everything you need to get started homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
                           <p>The          first step to start officially homeschooling is to submit an          education plan to your local school superintendent or school committee.          Traditionally, this has been done via certified mail with  return receipt service sent to your          local superintendents' office. Many towns will now also accept          emailed plans (it doesn't hurt to send it both ways). However you send it, remember to get a receipt. If you are          withdrawing your child mid-year, you may also want to notify the          school that your child won't be returning.</p>
                           <p>
                           It is important that all homeschooling parents know their rights and          responsibilities. We encourage everyone to educate themselves on the          law and what is and isn't required. Our mission at AHEM is to          provide you with the resources to empower yourself. A great place to          start is to review the following pages:</p>
                           <ol class="nestedordered">
                             <li><a href="../../hs_guidelines.html">Homeschool Guidelines at a Glance</a></li>
                             <li><a href="../../tips.html">Tips for Writing Your Education Plan</a></li>
                             <li><a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">Sample Education Plan</a></li>

                           </ol>
                           <p>Also,          remember, kindergarten is not mandatory in Massachusetts. <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr8.html?section=all" target="_blank">Compulsory attendance</a> is in effect          from ages six to sixteen. You only need to submit a plan this school          year if your child turned six in 2021. (You would submit an education plan for the 2022-2023 school year if your child turns six in 2022.)</p>
                             <p>
