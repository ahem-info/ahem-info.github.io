       <h1>The S-Word</h1> 
		   <h2>How to Think About the Socialization Question</h2>
<h4>by Roberta Van Vlack </h4>

		   <p>If you have even considered homeschooling, you have probably  had the S-word thrown at you. The first thing I always recommend when someone  asks the dreaded question <q>What about socialization?</q> is to ask them what they  mean by that term. </p>
           <p>
           I&rsquo;d like to suggest that there are three main ways that  people use the term. Socialization can mean simply social time i.e. time spent  with peers. It can refer to specific habits and practices which people are  expected to learn and use. I am thinking here of things like standing in line,  saying please and thank you, and more subtle social skills like how to  participate in a group discussion. Lastly, socialization can refer to one&rsquo;s  ability to be relational&mdash;to form,   build, and negotiate relationships. </p>
           <p>For some, socialization just means time to socialize. It is  spending time with peers. It is hard to deny that most school kids get way more  time with their peers, but I would like to suggest that when discussing what is  best for a given child that we consider the following:</p>
           <ul class="nested">
		   <li>Quantity  is not the same as quality. Many school kids have to be told not to socialize  in the middle of class. Homeschooled kids may have less overall face time with  peers, but their interactions tend to come in contexts in which they are  allowed and even expected to chat and play.</li>
           <li>The need  for social time varies, both among individuals and over one&rsquo;s lifetime. My own  very unscientific observation is that little kids really don&rsquo;t need much social  time with people other than family. The drive for social time at this age often  comes from parental needs and expectations, not the child&rsquo;s. Middle age kids  (maybe 7-11) seem to need a bit more and teens are even more peer-focused. But  there are also individual variations. I have one child who tires of being  around people very quickly. (Quarantine was not a hardship for her.) Again,  parents need to distinguish between their own needs and that of their child. If  your child is happy, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to push for more (though there  may be separate issues when there are developmental concerns). In a family,  there may also need to be some compromise. The more social person may need to  do with a bit less and the less social might have to get out a bit more than they  like.</li>
           <li>How much  social time happens naturally as a part of your family life? If you have nine  kids, odds are your eight-year-old already has someone to play with. If you have an  only child, you may need to make more effort to find playmates once in a while.</li>
           <li>We don&rsquo;t  always want what is good for us. Another very unscientific observation: the  teens who seem to crave a lot of time with peers are also those who are most  insecure and most easily influenced and led. (Of course, in these days of  social media, homeschooled kids are not protected from this kind of social  mania just because they stay within their own four walls.)</li>
           <li>Which  leads us to&mdash;not all social time is good social time. Peer pressure is a  thing. The time your child spends with other kids may either a) make him  unhappy or b) make him happy but teach him things you don&rsquo;t want him to learn.</li>
           <li>Peer  social time is not the only option. Peers are good. I am not suggesting we  isolate our children from other kids their age, but homeschoolers are more  likely to get social time with people not born within 12 months of them.</li>
           <li>Don&rsquo;t  underestimate the value of a little loneliness and boredom. Being forced to be  on our own helps us become who we are (and perhaps a little less of just who we  want our peers to think we are).</li>
		   </ul>
           <p>The second kind of socialization is the learning of skills.  What these important skills are is another discussion, but here again are some  points to consider:</p>
		   <ul class="nested">
           <li>Some  skills can be learned, and perhaps learned better, in real world contexts.  Homeschooled kids below a certain age have to go places with their parents.  Places like the grocery store and the bank. Here they will learn valuable  real-life skills like waiting in line. And they will do so in real world  contexts.</li>
           <li>Not all  school kids are well-socialized. I have watched the socialized school kids in  tennis camp with my kids. They are awful at waiting in line. </li>
           <li>Some  skills are harder to learn at home. In this category I would put things like  participating in group discussions. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a deal breaker,  however. Being aware of the gaps, of what your homeschooled kid might be  missing out on, lets you know what you might need to seek out or work on.</li>
           <li>Some  skills are better not learned. Oddly one of the big ones you hear is &ldquo;how will  your kids learn to deal with bullies if they don&rsquo;t go to school?&rdquo; Personally, I  would rather my kid not have to deal with a bully. Not that there aren&rsquo;t  bullies in the adult world but knowing what is normal and acceptable behavior  is hugely important. Thinking that bullying is normal and regular is not good.  My oldest said one of the hardest things when he went to college was dealing  with all the drama his peers were wrapped up in all the time. It was new to  him. But I would rather he is able to see the drama for what it is and know  that human relationships don&rsquo;t have to be that way.</li>
           <li>Again,  there are good skills and bad skills one can learn. Both can also be found at  most homeschool park days.</li>
			   </ul>
           <p>Lastly, we come to what is probably the most important kind  of socialization: Being able to build and maintain relationships. Here I would  refer you to David Elkind’s <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/david-elkind/the-hurried-child-25th-anniversary-edition/9780738210827/?_ga=2.114369856.638833266.1659963037-1419397444.1659963037" target="_blank">The Hurried Child</a></em>. He lays out his theory of how  parents socialize their children which boils down to: we relate to one another  through social contracts. The parent-child one is multifaceted and subtle. It  is about freedom and responsibility but also about trust and loyalty. Elkind  argues that this primary relationship is unequal and that kids need peer  relationships too because they are equal and require a different kind of  negotiation. It is in these close, long-term relationships that we really build  relationship skills. It is the long-term relationships in our lives that  challenge and stretch us. Elkind implies that a young child going from home to  school to daycare is hurried and suffers for it emotionally. He has too many  relationships to juggle and they don’t come with the loyalty and trust that the  parent-child relationship does. I would argue that the homeschool environment  is much better for being able to build these long-term relationship skills that  are really the most essential type of socialization. The relationships a child  has may be fewer but they have depth.</p>
<p>So the next time your mother-in-law says the S-word to you,  ask her what kind of socialization she means and hopefully you will have some  arguments to show her that homeschooled children are not inherently  disadvantaged in this area.</p>
