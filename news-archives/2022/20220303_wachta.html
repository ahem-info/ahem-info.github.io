                             <p>
                             When I toured the high school that I          would be attending from ninth to twelfth grade, I admit that I was feeling a          little nervous. It was an anxious feeling that was a lot          bigger than when I was moving from elementary to          middle school. However, something else didn&rsquo;t feel          right. When the school tour was over, I began getting a          tickly feeling in my throat. When I was born, I had to have a          trach put in to help me breathe better. I&rsquo;ve had it forever,          so we have to take extra good care of it by cleaning and suctioning it          to keep me healthy. As it turns out, the high school was an          old building. The air quality would not be good for my          trach, so Mom, Dad, and I got together to think about what we should          do. Mom, who&rsquo;s always concerned about what happens to my trach was          terrified of sending me to a school that was unhealthy for me, and I          was nervous about getting suctioned every single day throughout the          school year. It&rsquo;s safe to say we were both on the same page, so what          could we do instead? Eventually, with a little bit of          research, Mom suggested that we try homeschooling. It was a          big risk, but it was the only alternative we could think of. I never          knew how much fun I&rsquo;d have throughout those four years. This is          the story of my experience as a homeschooler.</p>
                             <p>
                             Many may wonder what a homeschool experience entails. I&rsquo;m          here to give you an idea. Most people are quick to believe          that homeschooling lacks a structured routine. Believe me, when I          first heard about homeschooling, I thought the very same thing.          But, in reality, most homeschool students maintain a high degree of          organization and planning. An example of some of my          activities in which I took part included: tutoring with Amy, art          classes taught by my Aunt Carolyn, attending plays at the Providence Performing          Arts Center, going on lots of exciting and educational field trips to          learn about historical places in our city, a girl&rsquo;s social group, and          writing classes at a local collaborative with my writing Coach Nicole          Cannella.</p>
                             <p>
                             Some examples of activities in my writing sessions included learning          more about myself through personal essay, arriving to and from class on          time, bonding with my fellow classmates while creating literature, and          knowing the joy of a completed project. In my art lessons,          my Aunt Carolyn and friend Alyssa would come to my home, and we would          make artworks with various types of mediums including paint, crayons,          markers, foam, wood, stickers, paper, and canvas. Each time          I have this class I feel like I bring out my inner artist. So          much so that most of my artwork is hanging on a wall in my dining room.          (For more information about my art pieces that I&rsquo;ve completed over the          course of my homeschooling art classes, take a look at my <a href="https://mailchi.mp/6b80cc0e47ca/mywallfullofcolor-6029898" target="_blank"><q>A Wall Full of Color.</q></a>) On          Wednesdays I would have an afterschool-like club at my friend Emma&rsquo;s. A          group of us girls, around 5 or 6, would get together and play games,          make crafts, and just hang out. Suffice it to say, we made the          right choice for our family.</p>
