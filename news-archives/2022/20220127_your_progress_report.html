       <h1>Your Progress Report Questions Answered</h1>
                   <p>This time of year we      begin to receive questions about progress reports. Some are already      worrying about what they will submit at the end of the year; others are      being asked for a midyear report. The following is a revised version of <a href="../../progress_reports.html">our article on progress reports</a>.</p> 
					   <h3>Progress reports written by the parent are an acceptable      form of evaluation.</h3>
                   <p>In Massachusetts, homeschooling parents, as the teachers of      their children, are responsible for evaluating their progress. <a href="../../charles.html"><em>CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHARLES &amp; others, 399      Mass. 324 (1987)</em></a> clearly outlines three forms of evaluation:      “Other means of evaluating the progress of the children may be substituted      for the formal testing process, such as periodic progress reports or dated      work samples, subject to the approval of the parents.” (<em>Charles</em> at 340)      Parents may choose one of them to fulfill their responsibility.</p>
<p><em>Charles</em> is clear that parents are the instructors and it is      appropriate and acceptable for parents to evaluate their students’      progress. AHEM’s research shows that almost half of Massachusetts      homeschoolers choose to submit a progress report, making it the most      popular choice.</p>
                   <p>AHEM has heard from homeschoolers in various districts where      school officials are hesitant to accept the authority of evaluations by      parents. In these cases, schools request standardized test scores,      extensive work samples, third party evaluations, or a parent-produced      progress report combined with a second form of evaluation, such as work      samples.</p>
                   <p>While school officials in the professionalized world of      education may not want to accept parental evaluations as valid, the law in      Massachusetts clearly allows parental evaluation. Homeschooling parents who      want to choose a progress report as their form of evaluation need not be      intimidated by demands for more.</p>
                   <p>Here&rsquo;s one example of a way that a district might question      your authority to evaluate the education of your children: In some      districts, school officials create forms to facilitate their responsibility      for homeschool oversight. Sometimes, the list of evaluation choices offered      doesn&rsquo;t include progress report, but may or may not include <q>other.</q>      Homeschoolers can either write in <q>progress report</q> under the <q>other</q> category,      or create an <q>other</q> category and write in <q>progress report.</q></p>
                   <h3>If your district asks for more</h3>
                   <p>Some districts send out conditional approval letters stating      that the education plan approval is conditioned on the submission of extra      forms of evaluation. The response to such a letter could be based on      various factors including the homeschooling family's past experience with      the district, or the school official's track record with homeschoolers. One      response could be to do nothing and submit the evaluation outlined in the      original plan. Another option could be to respond with a letter thanking      the school for the approval and reiterating that the form of evaluation      outlined in the original plan will be submitted at the appropriate time.</p>
                   <h3>What about midyear reports?</h3>
                   <p>As quoted above, <em>Charles</em> mentions <q>periodic progress      reports.</q> The <q>period</q> is not specified. However, <em>Charles</em> is clear that <q>…the      approval of a home school proposal must not be conditioned on requirements      that are not essential to the State interest in assuring that all the      children shall be educated.</q> Since many towns accept annual evaluations, a      district would be hard pressed to argue that more frequent reporting is      <q>essential.</q> Again, your response to such requests will depend on a lot of      factors. If you specified that you would submit an annual report, one      option would be to respond with a letter reminding them that in your      approved plan you specified an annual report.</p>
                   <h3>What should be in my progress report?</h3>
                   <p>A progress report may be a simple list of subjects with      progress in each area noted. <a href="../../sample_progress_report.html">A very simple sample progress report is available on      the AHEM website.</a> Your school district may request more      <q>evidence of progress.</q> If they do, you can resubmit the report adding      info to it.</p>
                   <h3>AHEM is here to help</h3>
                   <p>Individual circumstances play a big role when determining      how to respond to requests from school officials. As always, <a href="../../one-on-one.html">AHEM representatives</a> are available to talk      through options.</p>
                   <p><em>This legal summary was not drafted by practicing lawyers and      is not intended to constitute official legal advice, but rather is      presented by AHEM volunteers and is based on their reading and      understanding of Massachusetts homeschooling requirements as they have      followed those requirements throughout the years. Readers still need to      make their own decision on how best to proceed.</em></p>
