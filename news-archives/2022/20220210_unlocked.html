<h1>Meet          Massachusetts Homeschoolers: Young People's Society of Storywriters</h1>
		   <a href="https://amzn.to/3Jl0Rp9" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/amazon/Unlocked.jpg" alt=""></a>
<h4>By Isabella Watkins</h4>
		   <p>Homeschooling          is ideal for the writing process. It not only gives you time to work on          your craft, it also gives you the freedom to work with whomever you want.          Writing with a group of friends who feel like family has helped my          writing improve, and sharing my writing with supportive people has          heightened my confidence in my work.</p>
                           <p>I          belong to the Young People’s Society of Storywriters, a group of          homeschooled teen writers and artists who meet weekly to write          together. We published our debut anthology of short stories and poetry          in November of 2021: <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Jl0Rp9" target="_blank">Unlocked: An Anthology of Short Stories and          Poetry</a></em>.</p>
                           <p>Our          group first assembled in 2017 when most of us were around 10, 11, or          12. The first class saw us gathered around a dining room table, with a          mason jar of pencils presiding over it, in the home of one of the          students in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We sat around the table with our          writing mentor, Milva McDonald.</p>
                           <p>I          was 10. It was my first year homeschooling, my first homeschool class.          I had never known anyone my age who liked to write, and I had rarely          let anyone read what I wrote. I was so nervous I thought I would          dissolve into butterflies. What if no one here was actually a serious          writer and they only came because their parents made them? Or, even          worse, what if they are true, talented writers? Then how am I to          compare?</p>
                           <p>It          was soon obvious, through hearing what everyone wrote, that they were          all real writers, and they all sat at that table by choice. And, from          listening to their responses to each other&rsquo;s writing, I realized they          were all very kind. They were accepting, too, no matter what you wrote          about, regardless of whether writing was an interest or a calling. In          her novel Emma, Jane Austen uses the word <q>imaginist</q> to describe          creative thinkers, and I think that word sums us up pretty well.</p>
                           <p>My          writing has transformed in the past five years. I&rsquo;m not afraid to try          new genres or ideas, or add messages meaningful to me, and I think          that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve spent so much time workshopping with smart,          considerate people. Our teacher, Milva, is a stellar editor, and one          who&rsquo;s always willing to look at what we write outside of class, as          well.</p>
                           <p>Our          group met weekly in Cambridge, MA, until 2020,until COVID-19 hit. We          had a couple more in-person meetings filled with hand sanitizer and          wariness before the lockdown. We moved online, and our class expanded          when we got a new member from Northern Wales.</p>
                           <p>In          October 2020 Milva suggested that we compile some of our short stories          and poems and publish them in an anthology. Over the next few weeks          most of the people in our group added at least one story and a poem to          a Google document she set up. Then we spent multiple months revising          our writing. Three of our members illustrated several of the stories.          Milva edited and provided feedback on our stories and poetry.</p>
                           <p>We          had Zoom meetings outside of class to discuss which platform we were          going to use for publishing, who was going to be in charge of          formatting the book, and, most importantly, what we were going to name          it. After several meetings, we finally settled everything in the early          summer of 2021. We would publish on Kindle and Amazon, I would be in          charge of formatting, and our book would be called Unlocked (derived          from one of our title ideas, Stories Unlocked During Lockdown).</p>
                           <p>Amazon          provides a formatting software called Kindle Create, but you have to          apply a specific style guide to your manuscript before you can run it          through Kindle Create. The process was really hard to understand, at          first, but I found that it was a lot easier to fathom the formatting          instructions once I actually began formatting. No one I knew had ever          formatted a book, so I didn&rsquo;t have anyone to give me help or advice          when I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend the instructions, or felt overwhelmed. It          was very satisfying, when it stopped being frustrating, to learn a          skill entirely on my own. And now I know how to format a book, and I          hope to put that ability to use very often.</p>
                           <p>The          experience of publishing a book together was edifying and          fulfilling—and fun. We, the students, took the reins on this project,          so we did most of the decision-making, research, and problem-solving. I          went from never having had anyone read my writing, to reading it in          class, to self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>
                           <p>The          most rewarding part of the project was that I got to do it with my          friends. We had a virtual potluck at the end of the summer in 2021 to          celebrate our upcoming publication and to give an audience of our          friends and family a preview of our writing. I was honored to organize          and co-host with one of my friends from class, Caitlin. She and I          decided to make a list of highlights from our time in class to read at          the potluck. One of the things she wrote was:</p>
                           <blockquote><q>The          enthusiasm of our group when it comes to story writing and reading is          truly uplifting and inspiring. It&rsquo;s so wonderful to be friends with          such talented writers. It makes you want to try harder, to experiment          and to learn&mdash;as everyone else is doing.</q></blockquote>
                           <p>Being          in this group has inspired me to push myself, because, as Caitlin          perfectly stated, that&rsquo;s what everyone else is doing, and that&rsquo;s what          we&rsquo;re here to do.</p>
                           <p>For          five years our group has written together. I joined at 10—now I&rsquo;m 15.          We&rsquo;re learning together and growing up together, and that&rsquo;s very          special, and such a joy. We&rsquo;ve already decided that we&rsquo;re going to have          frequent writing class reunions, even if, at some point in the future,          our class disbands while we pursue careers or college. We have one book          on the Amazon shelves, and many more projects to come. We continue to          meet over Zoom, to write, read, discuss, learn, and just be          together.</p>
