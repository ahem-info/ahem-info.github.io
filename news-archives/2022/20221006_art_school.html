<h1>So Your Child Wants to be an Artist</h1>
    <h2>Advice for Applying to Art School</h2>   
		<h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
	 		<p>I have one child whom we always knew would be an artist.  From age two when she drew sad spiders obsessively, her calling was clear. At  age seven, we took her to a program at the American Textile History Museum in  Lowell (now, sadly, defunct) and had to pull her away from the hands-on loom  exhibit to give other children a chance. Today she is a senior at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) majoring in textiles, and weaving specifically, with a  minor in painting.</p>
     		<p>While I am no expert, I thought today I would share what we  have learned about applying to art schools. </p>
            <h3>Where to Apply</h3>
            <p>One of the first decisions to make is whether your child  wants an art school specifically or whether they would be happy at a college  that has an art major.  If your child is  not sure that art is what they want or if they just have other academic  interests, then a college with an art major but also with other options may be  a better choice. RISD won my daughter&rsquo;s heart when they said that if she went  there she would never again be required to take a math or science course and  that if she needed any math they would slip it in surreptitiously like hiding  spinach in brownies. In truth, RISD does require students to take a certain  number of liberal arts classes (and my daughter is even	&mdash;gasp!	&mdash;taking a  geology course this year of her own free will) but their <q></q>core</q> requirements are  much fewer than at other schools. Other art schools, like Massachusetts College  of Art and Design (MassArt), have more breadth requirements but will still  require less than a traditional college. </p>
            <p>If your child likes doing art and nothing but art all their  waking hours, then a school like RISD may be a good fit. I can&rsquo;t speak to the  schedule at other art schools, but RISD classes are six to eight hour studios that meet  once a week and have plenty of homework, usually in the form of elaborate  projects. To quote my daughter: <q>if you want to have time to do anything other  than art, RISD is not the place for you.</q> (This is apparently not 100% true  since she has found time to be a founding member of RISD&rsquo;s ice skating club.)  If your child wants to have time for sports and clubs and a social life, then  they may prefer the traditional college option.</p>
            <p>Again I can&rsquo;t speak to other schools but RISD would also not  be a good fit for students who have one very particular artistic interest. The  freshman year at RISD is a foundation year that is the same for all students.  Even if you never want to draw charcoal portraits, you will be required to do  so in your first year at RISD. (They say you can recognize the first years walking  around campus because they have a greyish tinge to them.)</p>
            <h3>How to Get In</h3>
            <p>If you have gotten this far and still think that art school  may be a good fit for your child, then let&rsquo;s talk about the admissions process.  In applying to an art school, you will still have to do many of the same steps  that come with any college application. You will need transcripts and  recommendations. You may need to write the dreaded college essay and you may  need standardized test scores (when my daughter applied, RISD still required  SAT or ACT scores; they have since dropped that requirement, much to her  chagrin). </p>
            <p>The biggest factor in art school admissions, though, is the  portfolio.  For RISD at least there were  two parts to the portfolio&mdash;you submit 12-20 pieces of work you have already  made and you create two brand new pieces following prompts that the school  provides. These days all of these are submitted electronically.</p>
            <p>When we toured MassArt in Boston, they said that a student  who has a particular interest, e.g. film-making, can provide a portfolio which  only includes that medium. For RISD this was not the case. Having gone through  the process, our impression is that art schools are looking for breadth and  creativity rather than just skill (though skill doesn&rsquo;t hurt). You could be  great at figure drawing but you need to show them some different kinds of art  as well&mdash;different media, different techniques and styles, etc. (Be sparing  with certain media, however&mdash;from everything we have heard, RISD is not  impressed with anime and it is better not to include it.) My daughter knew she  wanted to go into fiber arts so it was not too much of a stretch for her to  include different media but she also had classic things&mdash;figure drawing and  still-lifes and the like. Even there she tried to be a little different by  drawing unusual objects instead of just bowls of fruit and flowers.</p>
            <p>Not every piece needs to be perfect. For a few pieces, you  can talk about your process and what you might have done differently. With  online submissions, you may just get one image for each, but you can combine a  few images on one page if an object needs to be shown from multiple angles (for  3D objects, for instance) or to show the stages you went through. Of course,  the goal is still to show the best of what you can do. </p>
            <p>It is helpful to look at others&rsquo; portfolios and to get  feedback on your own before you submit it. One can find videos online in which  admitted students show their portfolios so you can see what made the cut. My  daughter also joined a Facebook group on RISD admissions and got some tips  there. She got portfolio reviews from a few places&mdash;one from a friend who is  a RISD grad, one from MassArt which offers a free portfolio review with its  tour, and one from an online site (ACAD). Though we never made use of this  option, there are also national portfolio review days at colleges across the  country. </p>
            <h3>The High School Years: Preparation</h3>
            <p>I suggest beginning to think about your portfolio and to try  to make portfolio-worthy pieces in ninth grade. Though in the end everything my  daughter included was recent, she was glad that she had been thinking in those  terms throughout high school. </p>
            <p>As she prepared, my daughter intentionally sought out  extracurricular classes that would help her improve in areas she knew she was  weak in. Because we live close to RISD, she took some summer workshops there  (this was about skill building; I don&rsquo;t think it directly helped with  admissions). She also had a private art teacher for a while. There are some  more expensive art studios near us that would have helped with portfolio  creation but we never went that route. </p>
            <p>Up to a certain point, academics are going to be less  important if your child is applying to an art school. You probably still want  to present a well-rounded transcript but taking Physics and Calculus may not be  a priority. I pushed my daughter through Algebra 2 and Geometry as well as  Chemistry but after those were done I let her select less traditional math and  science courses. Of her own initiative, she took a number of art-based courses  in high school including AP Art History, AP Studio Art, and some graphic design  courses. I am not sure that Algebra and Chemistry benefited her at all but I  suspect that having some academic art classes on her transcript helped at least  to the extent of demonstrating a consistent interest in art.  </p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ll wrap up with one cautionary piece of advice and one  encouraging one&mdash;</p>
            <p>If your child thinks they want to go to an art school, seek  out honest criticism of their work. It is easy for us as parents to think  everything our child does is wonderful, but it is important to get other  assessments. This will help your child grow artistically and will maybe give  you a heads up if they need to take more time and expand their skill set. (As a  side benefit, it will also prepare them for art school itself which relies  largely on critique as a means of evaluation.)</p>
            <p>And for the positive note&mdash;if you have gotten far enough  to be considering these things, then you have raised a creative, passionate  individual. If by some chance they don&rsquo;t get into their first choice school on  their first try, encourage them not to give up. The world needs artists and  there is a place for them somewhere if they just keep pursuing their calling.</p>
