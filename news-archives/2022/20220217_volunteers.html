         <h1>AHEM Needs You!</h1>
		   <h3>Your skills,  expertise, and helping hands!</h3>
           <p>AHEM is &ldquo;staffed&rdquo; by a small handful of currently homeschooling  or formerly homeschooling parent volunteers.&nbsp;To stay viable, we need young  families with skin in the game who care about keeping independent homeschooling  as an educational option to step up and help out if Massachusetts homeschoolers  are&nbsp;to keep the right to homeschool the way they want to homeschool.</p>
  <h3>Several virtual opportunities are available:</h3>
         <ul class="nested"
           <li><strong>Town Point Person</strong> - As a town point person you       would be an entry point for homeschooling families, new and       established, with others in your town trying to connect with others       locally. <a href="../../tpp.html">More info here. </a>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>Write </strong><em><strong>Meet Massachusetts       Homeschoolers</strong></em><strong> piece</strong> - Do you have a unique homeschooling       experience? We are seeking pieces for our <em>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers</em> feature. This is a great chance to talk about yourself, what makes your       homeschooling unique. We are not ageist and welcome writing by children,       teens, and adults. <a href="../2020/20201001_meet_ma_hsers.html">More info here.</a></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li><strong>Help Monitor Legislation</strong> -       Assist our board member in keeping an eye on state-wide legislation that       may affect homeschooling. <a href="../../vol_app.html">Complete volunteer application here.</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>If you are interested in any of these opportunities, or have  another skill or talent you think would be valuable to share, <a href="../../vol_app.html">please get in touch</a>!  We are more than happy to give you details. Thanks so much for considering!</p>
