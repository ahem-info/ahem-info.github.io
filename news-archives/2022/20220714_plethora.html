         <h1>A Plethora of Resources<h1>
			 <h2>Navigating AHEM's Website &amp; Finding the Help You Need</h2>
           <p>Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts (AHEM) has  been helping homeschoolers in Massachusetts for almost two decades now. In that  time, we have heard a lot of stories, answered a lot of questions, and  accumulated a lot of resources. While we feel we have a lot to offer, we also  understand that it can be a lot to navigate, whether you are brand new to  homeschooling or an old-timer looking for the answer to a particular question.</p>
         <h4>To aid in the process, we offer the following quick guide to  finding what you need on the AHEM website:</h4>
         <p>For information on reporting as a homeschooler in Massachusetts,  see our <a href="../../reporting.html">Reporting</a> page. Click through to find a <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a> template  and a <a href="../../sample_progress_report.html">sample progress report</a>. <em>Pro Tip:</em> One of our most helpful pages is our  <a href="../../tips.html">Tips</a> page. If you think your town is asking for more than they need or you  aren't sure what you need to put in your education plan, this is the place to  start.</p>
         <p>Want to read the case laws affecting homeschooling for  yourself? You can find them on the <a href="../../ma_hs_law.html">Massachusetts Homeschool Law</a> page. Want a  quick summary for now? Check out   <a href="../../hs_guidelines.html">Homeschool Guidelines at a Glance</a> and <a href="../../unsnarling_charles.html">Unsnarling <em>Charles</em></a>.</p>

         <p>Looking for others in your area? See our <a href="../../networking.html">Networking</a> page for  local groups or ask to be connected with your <a href="../../tpp.html">Town Point Person</a>  (or if your town doesn't have one yet, <a href="../../vol_app.html">volunteer</a> to be that person!).</p>
         <p>Looking for resources on academics and how to educate? See  our <a href="../../resources.html">Resources</a> page. Be sure to scroll through and you will find information on  <a href="../2021/20210826_styles.html">homeschooling styles</a>, <a href="../2021/20210923_college_part_1.html">homeschooling high school</a>, <a href="../2021/20211014_college_part_2.html">applying to college as a  homeschooler</a>, and much more!</p>
