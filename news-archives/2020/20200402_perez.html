		   <h1>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Perez Family</h1>
	     <img src="../../images/perez202004.jpg" alt=""/>
<p><strong>By  Patricia Zarate Perez</strong></p>
         <p>With almost 60 million Latin@s living in the United States, it  is very possible one such family is homeschooling in Massachusetts. Los Perez,  with mother Patricia from Chile, father Danilo from Panama, and children  Daniela (16), Carolina (14), and Danilo Andres (9) have lived in a liminal  space for decades.&nbsp;In the intersection of the LatinX immigrant community,  the academic circles of Boston, and the musical world of Berklee College,  homeschooling is at the core of our values.</p>
         <p>Our children have never attended a school. They have been  homeschooled since birth in the state of Massachusetts, where the homeschooling  community is very organized and children grow with many privileges not seen in  many countries of Latin America, like libraries, museums, beautiful parks. It  is difficult to explain what homeschooling is to the grandparents who fought  hard to come out of poverty or out of rural areas to go to school. A world that  seems surreal at first, homeschooling is a journey of constant love,  compassion, and courage. With courage to decide to homeschool in Massachusetts,  love to embrace the new adventure, and compassion to understand the worries of  our families back in Latin America, learning at home was the best decision we  made as parents of three beautiful children. The journey has not been easy. Our  decision to homeschool affected our larger families greatly. We became the  outcasts inside family and friend circles back in our countries. Mothers cried  and begged to send our children to school to &ldquo;learn English,&rdquo; fathers asked  about the socialization of their grandchildren. How could we obliterate our own  education and deprive our children of such experience?&nbsp;What about the  sacrifices our parents made for us to study in America—for what? To finally  decide to take our children out of the school system?</p>
         <p>After being students in Boston, then professionals, and then  parents, homeschooling was a decision we took after careful study. Reading John  Holt, John Taylor Gatto, and many others during pregnancy and first years of life,  we decided by age six that&nbsp;we were reporting to the authorities we were  homeschooling our children in our home in Quincy, MA. But even after studying  different ways to homeschool, nobody could assure us homeschooling was going to  work for us. Only time would tell and we would have to arm ourselves with  courage to undertake such transformation.<br>
           <br>
           The first years of homeschooling were heroic for us—father working after hours,  mother exhausted in the home trying to figure it out. Our children were totally  not impressed, traumatized, or disturbed by our homeschooling practices. They  were just fine. The children pretty much adjusted, followed instructions, and  behaved just like children. They loved to play, read, go to the museums,  movies, and libraries of Boston, and take field trips. They were just happy to  be home with us parents. They learned to read books, write narratives, and play  music. Sometimes they misbehaved, and they were grounded. When either of us  parents lost control of our lives, schedules, relationships with family or  friends, they looked in awe as if we needed homeschooling for a while. We  learned that what the books said was one thing, and making it happen in real  life with three very different children and in different cultural contexts was  another. Homeschooling our children continuously opened our minds as well as  our hearts. Living in the space between what experts said was good for  youngsters and what we felt was good for our children was and still is a  constant struggle. Homeschooling made us hear many stories and study many  pictures to make better decisions for our children. Love, courage and  compassion had to be at the core of all decision making.</p>
         <p>Our three children became different people because of  homeschooling. They have gone through different phases in their academic lives,  from not paying any attention to math, to loving it, from not reading a word,  to reading obsessively, from abhorring to admiring each other. We found that  the healthiest way to show our love for them was to help them become  independent learners and thinkers who can rely on us while also maintaining  their autonomy. They have experienced many subjects they love, and others they  do not like so much and that has created a sense of their passions. They want  to do many things in life, they love the process of learning, and most  important, they feel loved. They are loved by us parents, and also by their  larger families who, after 16 years, have seen nothing atrocious in the act of  homeschooling. After decades of fighting it, our families have eased into the  idea that we, as parents, decided to homeschool our children.</p>
         <p>Right when we were starting to feel confident about our  homeschooling practices, COVID-19 pandemic arrives. Now the coin has flipped,  and we are teaching homeschooling practices in our communities. Suddenly, our  words turned upside down and now our family needs our homeschooling tips to  keep their schooled children at home entertained and productive. Their faith in  the educational system they jealously defended 16 years ago collapsed in one  second, while their acceptance of homeschooling skyrocketed in a week. Now we  talk about love, compassion and courage as if it were&nbsp;the first time  people heard these words. Worried parents ask the same questions we asked over  a decade ago. We keep presenting the same strategy we used when we started  homeschooling. Love, a force of nature bigger than ourselves, compassion and  the concern for our loved ones, courage and strength in the face of pain and  fear is what will help us in the next phase of our homeschooling lives. Even if  you are one of those families who are homeschooling for the first time because  of the pandemic, this mantra applies to you. Today, more than ever make love,  compassion and courage the center of your family life, because when profound  disruption exists, we all end up in the same place, back home.</p>
