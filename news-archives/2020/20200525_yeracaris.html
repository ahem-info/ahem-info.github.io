<h2>Reflections on a Homeschooling Adventure</h2>
		   <p><strong>By Janet Yeracaris</strong></p>
         <p>When my husband and I got married, we bought a house in a town  with excellent schools, fully intending to have our kids educated by the public  system. By the time we had two actual children, and I was seeing how they were  growing and learning, how creative and quick and inventive they could be, I  thought, <q>We&rsquo;ll see how this school thing goes.</q> I knew that most schools,  regardless of how well funded, are very box-like, and there is a great deal of <q>fitting in</q> that must be done to be successful in that environment. Sure enough, as each of  them started elementary school, it became clear to me that they were likely to  thrive being cut loose to learn in their own time and in their own way. I  already knew other homeschoolers, and the leap to a home-based education was  not a big one. We left the box behind and set off for adventure.</p>
           <p>Our town took their school system very seriously, and I felt  the need to write good reports, but we were pretty much taking an <q>unschooling</q>  approach to the kids&rsquo; education. I&rsquo;m not that big on structure for its own sake,  but I wanted a way to keep better track of what we were doing. I made a weekly  chart of subject areas the schools would theoretically cover (math, history,  language arts, etc., taken from the school district&rsquo;s website), and every day,  as we hacked and slashed our way through our lives, I would write down anything  we did that fit into one of those categories. I also had a big <q>miscellaneous</q> category, where I&rsquo;d put things I thought were beneficial but that didn&rsquo;t fit  into the school system&rsquo;s list—making up alphabets and maps and games; attending  theater, music and dance events, as audience members and participants; going on  field trips to candy factories, dairy farms, public utility facilities; and so  much more.</p>
           <p>We followed our interests day-to-day, with me, as the <q>homeschooling parent,</q> occasionally pressing some program or outing on the  kids, although never anything they really resisted doing. Every year, when it  came time to write my homeschooling report for the school district, I&rsquo;d tally  it all up, and somehow, miraculously, we would have done useful work in pretty  much every area of the <q>curriculum.</q> Some years we made kind of a weak showing  in one area or another, but there were always compensating strengths, areas in which  the kids were excelling well beyond what they might be doing in a school  classroom. I was rather amazed and surprised every year—we were enjoying our  lives <em>and</em> getting the job done on paper.</p>
          <p>It was crystal clear to me that some concerns people often  raise around homeschooling were utter non-issues. Socialization? They were  spending time with kids of all ages and with adults, at park days and outings  and other gatherings of homeschoolers and of other family friends. They were  getting the most thorough and organic socialization I could imagine. The school  setup—with kids sorted into groups by age, with adult oversight that is often  too stringent, often too lax—does not happen naturally in life, and the  evidence is mounting that leaving this much socialization to the vagaries of  peer interactions is not beneficial. My kids learned to take each person on  their own merits, staying open to finding out who each person is, what they can  do, and what is special about them, without much concern about their age.</p>
           <p>Still, what parent doesn&rsquo;t worry about whether we&rsquo;re doing  what&rsquo;s best, making good choices, tending to everyone&rsquo;s needs? I fretted along  the way about not doing enough of this or enough of that. I had long lists of  resources and brilliant ideas. I wanted them to learn another language when  they were young. I had a list of field trips that was pages long. We tried to  do everything, but, just like they say, it&rsquo;s not possible. I regretted missed  opportunities, wondered whether we were choosing the best trade-offs, fretted  that perhaps we were too busy and needed to do less. It felt like part of the  job to worry.</p>
           <p>We&rsquo;re not at the end of the story yet, but now that my son  is graduating from college and my daughter is halfway through her college  education, I feel safe beginning to assess the results. Both kids are  interested in a wide variety of subjects, and they continue to be curious,  self-motivated learners. They know themselves well and have developed excellent  strengths in particular pursuits; they have a good sense for their own learning  styles and are inhabiting the world with a balance of confidence and  open-mindedness. We enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, as we have all along.</p>
           <p>I have few regrets about how our homeschooling adventure played out. Mostly, I wish I had worried less along the way.</p>
           <p><em>Janet enjoys cobbling a life together with many kinds of  activities (some of which are on hiatus at the moment): folk dancing and  singing, hosting house concerts, nonprofit arts board work, knitting, cooking, gardening.  Homeschooling lined up very well with her (non-existent) long-term career  goals.</em></p>
