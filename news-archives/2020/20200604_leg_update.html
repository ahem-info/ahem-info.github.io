         <h2>Bill regarding community college tuition</h2>
         <h4>S.1089</h4>
         <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION by Eric P.  Lesser</p>
         <ul class="nested">
         <li>1/22/2019 Senate Referred to the committee on Labor and  Workforce Development</li>
         <li>1/22/2019 House House concurred</li>
         <li>4/4/2019 Senate Discharged to the committee on Higher  Education</li>
         <li>4/8/2019 House House concurred</li>

         <li>4/23/2020 House Reporting date extended to November 20,  2020, pending concurrence</li>
         </ul>
         <p>(1) To be eligible for the scholarship a student shall be  admitted to, and enrolled fulltime in, an eligible postsecondary program within  five years following graduation, not including time spent in the United States  Armed Forces, from an eligible high school in Massachusetts, or completion of  high school as a Massachusetts home school student, or obtaining a GED® or  HiSET® diploma.</p>
       
         <p><em>Summary: This bill would create the Massachusetts  Workforce Opportunity Scholarship. The problem with it is that it introduces  the term <q>home school</q> into law, and would require defining what  qualifies as completion of high school. AHEM&rsquo;s thought is that it would be less  confusing to simply allow students to be eligible until a certain age, say 23,  not including time spent in the armed forces. AHEM has contacted Sen. Lesser&rsquo;s  office with this suggestion, but is not confident they understand our concern.</em></p>
        
         <p><em>AHEM position: Neutral, if language is changed.</em></p>

         </ul>
         <p>(b) As used in this section, the following words shall have  the following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:-  <q>Covered program</q>, (i) a child care center, as defined in section 1A  of chapter 15D; (ii) a school, whether public, private or charter, that  provides education to students in any combination of grade levels from  kindergarten to grade 12, inclusive, and including, but not limited to, any  school activity open to children who are home schooled; (iii) a recreational  camp; or (iv) an institution of higher education, whether public or private.</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: Repeals Section 15 of Chapter 76 and replaces it  with the Community Immunity Act. AHEM takes no position on vaccination. AHEM  contacted Rep. Donato&rsquo;s and Sen. Rausch&rsquo;s offices and asked that <q>home  schooled</q> be changed to </q>otherwise instructed</q> to match  statutory language in Chapter 76 Section 1, because we object to introducing  the term <q>home schooled</q> into statutory language, as doing so begs  its definition. Rep. Donato&rsquo;s aide said he appreciated the suggestion and would  forward it to legal counsel. We are awaiting a response from Sen. Rausch.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>
