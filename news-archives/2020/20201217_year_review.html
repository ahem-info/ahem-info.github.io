<p>2020 brought new challenges to AHEM, as it did to everyone. We tried our best to respond to needs as they cropped up and changed.</p>

<p><strong>For the influx of new homeschoolers</strong>—two-and-a-half times as many new AHEM subscribers in 2020 as in 2019—many of whom felt pushed to this option they knew little about because of concern over in-person learning amidst the virus, despair over the experience of remote learning, or just needing to be able to create some predictable family routine, we provided:</p>
<ul class="nested">
<li>Over 20 <em>Getting Started Homeschooling</em> and <em>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts</em> virtual presentations, hosted by AHEM or local libraries.</li>
<li><em><a href="20200316_covid_19.html">Home with Kids in the Time of COVID-19</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="20200416_yum.html">Yum: A Bite-Sized and Nourishing Homeschooling Strategy for All Ages</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="20200723_hybrid_hs.html">“Hybrid Homeschooling”</a></em></li>
</ul>	
<p><strong>For all homeschoolers,</strong> AHEM provided ways to connect with others when getting together is not possible:</p>
<ul class="nested">
<li><em><a href="20201001_meet_ma_hsers.html">Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers</a></em> series</li>
<li><a href="../../forum.html">AHEM Networking Forum</a></li>
<li>Town Point People (coming soon)</li>
</ul>	
<p><strong>Throughout the year, we reported on a variety of issues important to Massachusetts homeschoolers:</strong></p>
<ul class="nested">
<li><em><a href="../../handling_it.html">Handling It Ourselves</a></em></li>
<li><a href="20201119_freedom.html">Maintaining Homeschooling Freedom</a></li>
<li>Massachusetts <a href="20200702_leg_update.html">legislation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We were pleased to offer:</strong></p>
<ul class="nested">
<li><a href="../../documents/ed_plan_form_2020.pdf">Education plan form</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We could not have done any of this without the help of our volunteers (Shout-outs! to):</strong></p>
<ul class="nested">
<li>Milva M.</li>
<li>Melissa M.</li>
<li>Christina S.</li>
<li>Sarah H.</li>
<li>Leslee P.</li>
<li>Kateryna C.</li>
<li>Julie P.</li>
	</ul>
<p><strong>Ongoing efforts include:</strong></p>
<ul class="nested">
<li>Maintaining our comprehensive <a href="../../index.html">website</a>, including dynamic information such as <a href="../../networking.html">Networking</a> listings and <a href="../../news.html">News &amp; Events</a> pages along with go-to information on homeschooling in Massachusetts, including the widely used and accepted <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">AHEM sample education plan</a></li>
<li>Communicating with our <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">subscribers</a></li>
<li><a href="20200702_leg_update.html">Legislative watch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=lwP373yb5gBQFElJgDNE7A_3d_3d">Policy &amp; Practice Database</a> about homeschooling in Massachusetts. Questions were added to gather info on changing requests by school officials</li>
<li><a href="../../one-on-one.html">One-on-One help</a>, available by phone or email anytime</li>
</ul>
