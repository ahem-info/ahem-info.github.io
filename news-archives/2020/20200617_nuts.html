         <h1>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts - Waitlist</h1>
         <h4>Thursday, June 25, 2020, 6:30 - 8:00 PM</h4>
         <p>Whether you are actively homeschooling or are just  curious about homeschool regulations, policies, and procedures, you are invited  to attend <em>Nuts and Bolts of Homeschooling in Massachusetts.</em> The program will be  held in via <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> on Thursday, June 25, 2018, 6:30 - 8:00 PM. An invitation to join will be sent  prior to the meeting.</p>
         <p>This workshop will cover Massachusetts homeschool  guidelines; the history of homeschooling in MA; writing your education plan;  choosing a form of evaluation; and local homeschool policies. There will be  plenty of time for questions and discussion.</p>
         <p>The program will be presented by Amy Faeskorn. Amy is on  the board of Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, Inc. (AHEM), a  non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable educational organization that gathers and  disseminates information about homeschooling in Massachusetts through  education, advocacy, and events. She is also one of the voices you hear when  you call AHEM for help.</p>
