<h1>BEHIND THE SCENES AT AHEM: Melissa Monaghan</h1>
	   <img src="../../images/melissa.JPG" alt=""/> 
	 <p>Melissa Monaghan lives in Arlington with her family. She homeschooled her two children from preschool through high school and loved learning alongside her children, exploring their interests, and seeing them pursue their passions. As a result of her children’s interest in theater along with countless hours of volunteering for their shows, Melissa is pursuing her passion for costume design, working part-time as an Assistant Costume Designer for Your Costume Source and helping to design the costumes for local theaters. Being inspired by her children and with more time to focus on her interests, Melissa is also developing her skills as a photographer, recently exhibiting a work at a juried exhibition at the Arlington Center for the Arts. Her years before homeschooling were spent in the corporate world working in insurance, the entertainment industry, and executive search. She is excited to be a part of AHEM as the Treasurer, maintaining her connection with the homeschool community, and supporting other families on their homeschool journey.</p>
