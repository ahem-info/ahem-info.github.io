<h1><q>Hybrid Homeschooling</q></h1>
		   <p>The term <q>hybrid homeschooling</q> is being bandied about a lot this summer, with one  idea being that someone can homeschool, but drop their child off at some kind of  <q>program</q> for one or two days a week, or more. Other definitions might be  homeschooling while taking some classes at the local public school, joining a  co-op, or using accredited online programs while homeschooling.</p>

<p>Legally, part-time homeschooling does not exist in Massachusetts. You are  either enrolled in school, or you are not. When a homeschooler takes classes at  a public school, the school does not receive per pupil funding for that  student. Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible for an enrolled student to work out an  arrangement with their school to do part of their schooling at home, but this  would be up to individual schools, and is not common. So for enrollment, you&rsquo;re  either in or you&rsquo;re out.</p>

<p>Co-ops, groups of families who come together and share in educating their  children, have existed as long as homeschooling has. Co-ops run the gamut. One  co-op might rent a space and have parents or hired instructors teach classes  while parents and siblings gather on site, with some level of parental  involvement required, and a fee to join. Another co-op might be a few families  getting together once or twice a week at someone&rsquo;s home, with parents rotating  responsibility for planning activities. Yet another might be a group of  families who get together once a week at a park for free play, and various  activities branch off from that, planned by and for subsets of families.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of <q>hybrid homeschooling</q> isn&rsquo;t a hybrid at all. It&rsquo;s  simply homeschooling. As long as there have been homeschoolers, they have  chosen to use the resources of their community to augment their experiences.  Before the pandemic, there was a veritable explosion of museums, nature  sanctuaries, tutoring centers, private instructors, performing arts  organizations, and entrepreneurs marketing classes and activities to  homeschoolers. The availability of homeschoolers to enroll in programs during  daytime hours offered opportunity for otherwise empty spaces to be filled.</p>

<p>The popularity of à la carte offerings of local institutions was followed by  the development of so-called <q>learning centers</q> (also called <q>microschools</q>).  The whole idea of a <q>learning center,</q> a place you go to in order to learn,  runs counter to one of the most valuable tenets of homeschooling: learning  happens everywhere, all the time. But learning centers do provide a place for  parents to leave their children for several hours at a time, and sometimes for  more than one day a week.</p>

<p>Where do learning centers, institutions where large groups of children are  dropped off to be supervised by someone other than a parent, fit into the  Massachusetts regulatory scheme? On the face of it, it would be logical to  assume that they would be approved private schools (per Chapter 76, section 1 of  the Massachusetts General Laws) that allow part-time participation of  homeschoolers, or licensed day care centers. The reality is that many learning  centers use homeschooling law to skirt these regulations, which exist to protect  children and workers. Rather than jumping through the hoops necessary to get  approval as a private school, or bearing the scrutiny to be licensed as a day  care center, many learning centers simply require that in order to participate  you be a homeschooler, meaning that you have in hand an approved education plan  from your local district. The centers then invite you, at a cost, to drop your  child off at their space.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, homeschoolers have always taken advantage of  opportunities for group classes, private teachers, and homeschool co-ops to  supplement the learning they do at home. What’s relatively new is dropping your  homeschooled child off for multiple days a week, or even full-time, at a  building with a large group of other children and an adult who is in charge.</p>

<p>It is your duty as a parent to safeguard the well-being of your children. So if  you choose to use a &ldquo;learning center&rdquo; as part of what will make homeschooling  work for you, go in with eyes wide open and don&rsquo;t be shy about asking pertinent  questions:</p>
<ul class="nested">
	<li>Are they approved by the local city or town as a private school?</li>
<li>If not, are they a licensed day care provider?</li>
<li>What health and safety protocols are in place, such as training in first aid,  fire inspections, ratio of teachers to children?</li>
<li>Are criminal background checks done for staff and volunteers?</li>
<li>Do they carry insurance?</li>
<li>What is their philosophy (educational, leadership structure) and what are  their policies (safety, discipline, parental involvement)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Homeschooling parents demanding this kind of accountability will strengthen and  safeguard homeschooling itself.</p>
