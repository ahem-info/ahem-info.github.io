         <h1>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Kern Family</h1>

<h2>LIFE SCHOOLING</h2>
         <p><strong>By Anne Kern</strong></p>
         
         <p>In the late summer of 2018—with excitement and  some trepidation—I drove out to western Massachusetts with my homeschooled  daughter Jamila and watched her begin her college career. Had homeschooling  prepared her well enough? Was she as academically fit as the schooled students?  Was this the end of homeschooling?</p>
         <p>I returned home alone, part-worried,  part-happy. She is my only child and for the last 15 years I had raised her by  myself. What would our future hold? Our homeschooling experiment had begun  rather unusually—almost as an accident—with the understanding that we could  recommit or rescind that decision annually. My parents thought homeschooling  was an audacious act doomed to likely failure, and I was grappling with my own  insecurities. But ten astounding years later, I realized that homeschooling had  revolutionized our world. From uncertain beginnings, we had forged something  powerful—a landscape of learning without borders.</p>
         <p>We started homeschooling out of necessity and  without any philosophical underpinnings. These emerged on their own as time  passed and our experiences broadened. In the end, what we practiced was not  school-at-home and not attachment parenting and not <q>un</q>-schooling, but <strong><em>life</em></strong> schooling—the act of bringing curiosity and excitement, interest and passion,  teaching and learning to the ordinary actions of everyday life. So what at  first had seemed daunting—educating my child adequately outside the authority and  support of an officially sanctioned school system—transformed into pure joy.  Unbounded in space or time, our homeschooling became ubiquitous, holistic,  integrated, organic, inclusive, insightful, and fun.</p>
         
         <p>In a regular classroom, most teaching involves  a person of some authority—usually an adult—conveying knowledge to a group of  younger people, and this knowledge, or the problems being solved, often  presuppose a solution—a <q>correct</q> answer. But good teaching is not about  pouring predigested information into passive, waiting, empty vessels. Learning  is an <em>active</em> process. And it is not  only about mastery, but about being able to <em>think</em>:  constructing questions carefully, researching and gathering data, thoughtfully  considering conclusions, and critically evaluating sources. True learning is  also about sharing. One of the best avenues for building knowledge is through  presentation. To teach or explain a concept to someone else solidifies  understanding and is a recognition of the obligation to share knowledge as a  member of the intellectual community.</p>
         
         <p>During the course of a wonderful ecology class  in high school, Jamila learned about <q>riparian zones</q>—the fertile areas of land  bordering rivers and streams—and <q>edge effects</q>—a concept describing how there  is greater biodiversity in regions where ecosystems meet and overlap. Our  homeschooling displayed these same characteristics of diversity and abundance,  with a majority of learning taking place at the boundaries between disciplines:  forensic science, cultural anthropology, evolutionary psychology, human  geography, and environmental science. These multiple currents of learning and  eddies of deep discussion allowed for a cross-fertilization of subjects and  ideas. This, we realized, was what <em>life  schooling</em> was all about.</p>
         
         <p>And then Jamila left for college. Shortly  after her departure, I sensed from family and friends their tentative  expectation of my incipient loneliness, and their rather less tentative  certainty that homeschooling was over. The semester started. Jamila began  sharing her syllabus with me, her readings, her analyses, passions,  interpretations, and disagreements. She became excited about landscape studies,  community development, and urban planning. It was fascinating. It was  difficult. It was delightful. We discussed everything. Another semester passed,  and then a year, and then two. And finally I understood: physical distance made  no difference to our foundation of learning together for life. None.  Homeschooling was not dead. Life schooling lives on.</p>
