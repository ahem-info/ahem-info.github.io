		   <h1>Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Draft Homeschooling Advisory</h1>
		   <p>The Advisory is the document the Massachusetts Department  of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) submits to school officials  seeking information about homeschooling in Massachusetts. Approval and  oversight of home education is a local, rather than state, function in  Massachusetts. <em>Therefore, DESE is not involved in setting policy, overseeing  school district practices, or otherwise enforcing the Commonwealth's home  education law. </em>The document's intent, according to the DESE, is to provide a  neutral analysis of homeschooling law, and to answer the most commonly asked  questions about homeschooling.</p>
		   <p>In 2003, many homeschooling groups, including AHEM, took  issue with various sections of the Draft, such as those regarding prior  approval and special education, and met with the DESE lawyer to discuss their  concerns. Revisions were scheduled, but took years. The current version being  circulated is dated 2009. AHEM was only lucky enough to obtain a copy of it  recently from a friend, to whom it was forwarded by a school official.</p>
           <h4>Prior Approval</h4>
           <p>Like the 2000 Draft, the 2009 document uses a tone that  might intimidate superintendents and lead them to feel an obligation to come  down hard on homeschoolers who commence homeschooling without official  approval. On the bright side, a sentence has been added indicating that the  school committee or superintendent <q>must review the proposal within a  reasonable time.</q> Of course <q>reasonable</q> is subject to interpretation.</p>
           <p>Also, the DESE continues to insist that lack of response  from a school district does not imply approval, even though a good number of  districts in MA never acknowledge receipt of a plan (which is why AHEM suggests  getting a receipt of your plan&rsquo;s submission).</p>
           <p>Unfortunately the DESE also added language not found in <em><a href="../../charles.html">Charles</a></em> that the school can  inquire as to methodology to aid in evaluating an academic plan.</p>
           <h4>Special Education</h4>
           <p>The section on special education has been updated. A  question has been added that clarifies that <q>M.G.L. c 76 § 1 [i.e. that the  instruction in all the studies required by law equals in thoroughness and  efficiency, and in the progress made therein, that in the public schools in the  same town], should apply equally to students who are eligible for special  education services and those who are not.</q></p>
           <p>The 2009 Draft has deleted the option for the school to  appeal the parental decision to homeschool a child with special needs to the  Bureau of Special Education Appeals, which is in line with the <a href="../../sped.html">2006 federal  guidelines</a> regarding consent override procedures.</p>
           <p>While the Draft says a plan for a child with special  needs must meet the standard set forth in M.G.L. c 76 § 1 (see above), it still  seems to set a higher bar, adding that <q>the district should consider whether  the proposal <q>equals in thoroughness and efficiency</q> <em>the special,</em> [emphasis  added] as well as the regular, education that the student would receive in the  public school.</q> The Draft does, however, acknowledge that the home-based plan  does not need to detail services identical to those that the district would  provide on an IEP.</p>
           <h4>Face-to-face meetings</h4>
           <p>The DESE has added to the Draft the question, <q>May school  districts require a face-to-face meeting as a condition of approval of a  parent&rsquo;s proposed home schooling plan?</q> Their assessment is that a meeting may  be required only if it is <q>reasonable and essential in order to allow district  officials to properly review or evaluate the proposal.</q> Since AHEM&rsquo;s data  collection indicates that a majority of districts in Massachusetts have long  conducted homeschool oversight without face-to-face meetings, meeting the  standard of <q>essential</q> in a court of law would be very difficult. Still, a  school official bent on requiring a face-to-face meeting with an unwilling  parent as a condition of approval can make life stressful, even if the eventual  outcome is that the meeting cannot be required.</p>
           <h4>What does the DESE Draft Advisory mean for homeschoolers  in practice?</h4>
           <p>The Draft circulates even though it is not in final form,  allowing the DESE to avoid including it in its public documents online, and so  far avoiding dialogue with homeschool groups about its content. You may find  that your local district has incorporated parts of the advisory into their  policy even though the DESE does not have any authority to set homeschool  policy in Massachusetts.</p>
           <p>The best way to protect yourself from extralegal demands  made by school officials, whether they are inspired by the DESE Draft Home  Schooling Advisory or not, is to educate yourself about your rights and  responsibilities as a homeschooling parent in Massachusetts.</p>
