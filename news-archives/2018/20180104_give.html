                 <p>
                   Twelve years ago, my then 14-year-old son was in a book group, and explored  math and foreign languages at home. He volunteered at the library, American  Friends Service Committee, and Food Not Bombs. He took piano and guitar  lessons, studied music theory, and took a jazz class at the local community  college. He played in a couple of bands and was starting to learn about modern  digital multi-track recording.</p>
                 <p>My 11-year-old daughter read a lot, took violin lessons, sang in a  chorus, and took a dance class. She created a line of creams and balms to sell  at the homeschool craft fair. She started volunteering to take care of foster  kittens and took a workshop at Middlesex Community College to get certified in  American Red Cross Pet First Aid.</p>
                 <p>A lot has changed in the last dozen years. And a lot has stayed  the same.</p>
                 <p>Today my son freelances as a Recording Engineer in New York City.  My daughter works as an RN at UMass Memorial Medical Center.</p>
                 <p>Twelve years ago AHEM was started on the floor of an indoor gym  that parents chipped in to rent so families from our local support group had a  space to regularly hang out in when it wasn&rsquo;t playground weather.</p>
                 <p>It was empowering for us, starting an organization from the ground  up, creating a vision and working to make it reality. It was empowering for our  kids, especially our daughters, to see their mothers make it happen. I remember  mine, returning from the AHEM PO Box with a thick pile of envelopes, grinning, <q>Mom, you created a monster!</q> But then, we did a lot of starting stuff and  making things happen ten or so years ago.</p>
                 <p>The founders of AHEM were lucky enough to start homeschooling (for  me, 20 years ago) in a world where we desperately needed each other. If our  kids wanted or needed something, we made it happen.</p>
                 <p>Milva and I met in the mid-1990s when her daughter, then 11, and  my son, then 7, both went to weekly small group meetings to learn Italian with  a native speaker. Families opened their homes for weekly science clubs,  knitting circles, reading groups, you name it. <em>The Puddlejump Players,</em> a  homegrown group, put on an annual play for years, involving dozens of  homeschoolers. My kids were never in the shows, but we went to the performances  to support their friends&rsquo; efforts. Just like we went to the homeschoolers&rsquo; Fall  Fair year after year. I remember the first one we went to when my kids were  seven and four, and how inspired and excited they were by all the child  entrepreneurs there.</p>
                 <p>My kids enjoyed history and geography fairs, science fairs, craft  clubs, book groups, math classes, bands, and more, all activities and events  that I or other mothers and fathers organized, or that the children organized  themselves. As with AHEM, we made stuff happen.</p>
                 <p>Today, homeschoolers represent a market to museums and businesses.  Judicious use of these offerings can be a wonderful way to enrich your child&rsquo;s  life. But buyer beware—when I started homeschooling, we had to ask if a museum  or wildlife sanctuary would be willing to accommodate a group of homeschoolers  at off hours. As our numbers expanded, everyone got the idea, and now there are  offerings for homeschoolers everywhere you look. Some places have regular  classes during school hours. Some organizations sponsor ongoing &ldquo;homeschooler&rdquo;  days, with reduced admission and special activities. Even retailers are opening  their stores to offer classes for homeschoolers during the school day.</p>
                 <p>What might be lost by spending some bucks, and spending the day in  the car driving from one activity to the next? Overcommit to prepackaged  opportunities, and you might not have the time to spend a day in pajamas  reading and cuddling, or the space in a day to make a serendipitous discovery  born of nothing-to-do, or to experience a lush afternoon extending to sunset  hanging out at Walden Pond in the spring or fall, when everyone else is cooped  up in school. Or lingering at the park after a Frisbee game, or playground hopping  week to week, or hosting a potluck or meeting at your house. Organizing events  or get-togethers yourself is one of homeschooling&rsquo;s best kept secrets.</p>
                 <p>If you didn&rsquo;t sign up for those pre-packaged classes, you might do  what we had to do&mdash;put time and energy into a home grown experience for your  kids and other local homeschoolers. Then what happens? Your child meets other  kids who share his or her interest, and you make connections with other adults  who are homeschooling their kids. Those parts of homeschooling were, for my  family, very important parts, because we built a community of people who cared  about each other and were there for each other, and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about  really, right?</p>
                 <p>Ten years later, that&rsquo;s what abides.</p>
                 <hr class="hrbreak">
                 <p>Our lives are happening now, not something we&rsquo;re getting ready for  later. So are children&rsquo;s lives. That remains one of the things I am most  grateful for—my children living their lives at every age, blossoming in their  own time, having the time to figure out who they are and build relationships  and connections over years.</p>
                 <p>Those relationships weren’t just with other kids. Some of the  people they count as friends today are the other adults in their lives who took  an interest in them, mentored them, looked out for them, taught them,  encouraged them, advised them, and cheered them on. In his book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VQXddQ" target="_blank">The Healing Wisdom of Africa</a></em><em>,</em> Malidoma  Patrice Somé talks about mentoring: “Recognizing the presence of genius… in a  young person… begins with paying careful attention to the young person. One  becomes a mentor when one is found by a pupil. We need to know each other in  order for such opportunities to present themselves.” I would add that children  need the time and freedom to find and choose their mentors.</p>
                 <p>Somé says that people must work at becoming better connected to  each other by giving: &ldquo;Someone who believes that community exists in order to  provide for his or her needs without having to give anything in response will  probably never find the right community…&rdquo; Homeschooling creates the opportunity  to give to others. In so doing, we become better connected to them, and thereby  gain witnesses to our whole selves as individuals, which is the ultimate  fulfillment. In a world rife with networks, online and off, homeschooling  provides us, and especially children, with the landscape to be whole people in  the real world, not fragments, and from that to reap the benefits of community.</p>
                 <p>So while AHEM was created to protect our right to homeschool  independently, the act of homeschooling is anything but independent.  Homeschooling is more than just freedom to learn. It&rsquo;s more than just awesome  classes or innovative learning centers. It&rsquo;s time with family. It&rsquo;s building  close relationships with your kids. It&rsquo;s going through real life ups and downs  with the support of your friends, your community. It&rsquo;s kids finding their own  mentors by virtue of living an authentic life. Homeschooling encompasses  challenges like the individuality of homeschoolers (often all we have in common  is the fact that our kids aren&rsquo;t in school) and geography (we don&rsquo;t all live on  the same street or even in the same town). But homeschooling also gives us the  gift of time, if you&rsquo;ve resisted overscheduling, and the opportunity to give.  These things offer chances to forge real community.</p>
                 <p>Make it a priority to schedule time to spend with others, to get  to know each other. Don&rsquo;t focus solely on getting children to and from classes  and activities. Build relationships with other families, and remember that  building meaningful ones takes time. Use existing networks like e-lists, but  don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find a ready-made community. Ready-made communities don&rsquo;t  exist, they are an illusion. The only way you&rsquo;re going to get community is to  build it one person at a time from the ground up.</p>
                 <p>Although I had no idea what would be most important to me in  choosing a homeschooling lifestyle, in retrospect, I can see clearly that a  hugely valuable part of homeschooling isn&rsquo;t about the education. Some of my  fondest memories are of the get-togethers or groups we created ourselves.</p>
                 <p>The weekly park day, which we pretty much never missed, and which,  for me, evolved from playground hopping with a five-year-old and a toddler, to  watching my 6'2" son leap for a Frisbee at practice with the homeschool high  school Ultimate team.</p>
                 <p>The circle of moms on the beach at Walden shooting the breeze on  all topics, and when I say all, I mean all, my son sitting off to the side,  comfortably fingering his guitar, unfazed. Probably no better education for a  young man.</p>
                 <p>The relationships built in book groups with both of my kids and  their cohorts, the shared experience of reading the same book at the same time,  my delight in rereading a classic, and experiencing it through their eyes, too.  Finding out that it meant a lot to them to be there, enough that they had  dragged themselves out of bed and slogged through Melville&rsquo;s whales, whales,  whales to be a part of discussing <em>Moby-Dick</em> with our group, or  wrapping their brains around Morrison&rsquo;s <em>Beloved.</em></p>
                 <p>Marking the passage of time through community rituals like May  Day, the craft fair, presentation nights, or potlucks.</p>
                 <p>And of course the precious time spent with my children: Tapping  the maple tree in the back yard and spending the day boiling the gallon of sap  down to a tablespoon of syrup. Getting up at three a.m. to make hot chocolate  and head out past city lights to better view a meteor shower with my son during  his outer space obsession. Seeing my daughter enthralled after making water  explode in our home chemistry lab, or hanging out on the couch with her, just  being with her, as she fussed with her math, that she was determined to get the  better of in order to further her goal of going to college.</p>
                 <hr class="hrbreak">
                 <p>When our family decided to homeschool, it wasn’t about running  from school, although there was an element of anxiety about school. When our  son was two, out of curiosity I picked up <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2uaghYV" target="_blank">Teach Your Own</a></em> by  John Holt. Holt described a lot of what had been my school experience as a  “good” student for more than half my life at that time. But he also described  something I was seeing with my own eyes: the little explorer and scientist, the  small boy who very much wanted to fit into the tribe, very much, as John Holt  put, it a “loving, kind, serious and purposeful” little boy.</p>
                 <p>So the choice to homeschool, was, for us, a choice for something.  A choice to preserve and build on our child&rsquo;s curiosity and love of exploring  and learning. A choice to continue to put time as a family high on our list of  priorities.</p>
                 <p>In my work with AHEM, I hear from a lot of sad and panicked  parents who have children suffering in school and are looking for an  alternative. Their child&rsquo;s needs are not being met, and/or their child is being  abused and bullied by peers and/or teachers and administrators. The number has  grown over the years. An August 2013 survey from the National Center for  Education Statistics found that, <q>Ninety-one percent of homeschooled students  had parents who said that a concern about the environment of other schools,  meaning safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure, was an important reason for  homeschooling their child.</q></p>
                 <p>What this means is that for more parents, homeschooling is not  their first choice. They don&rsquo;t choose it because the homeschooling lifestyle  appeals to them. They choose it because they are trying to save their child any  way they can.</p>
                 <p>These families come to homeschooling looking for a lifeline, and  many do not have a clue what it entails or what they are getting into. They  might actually have no idea that the homeschool lifestyle can look like what I  have described. They want somewhere besides school to put their kids, and in  our free market economy, options are springing up for them, just as the museums  and nature sanctuaries sprang to offer classes to homeschoolers in the last  decade.</p>
                 <p>In the interest of protecting the right to independently  homeschool, hopefully we can consider whether an offering is necessary or  desirable when looked at in the context of our long term goals for our children  and families.</p>
                 <p>Learning centers, homeschool resource centers, self-directed  learning centers are springing up all over. They go by many names and take on  many forms, from places with an à la carte menu of groups and classes, to stand  alone buildings with paid staff where you can drop off your child all day. Some  are open a few days a week; others are open Monday through Friday.</p>
                 <p>A learning center can provide a crutch or stepping stone for  families entering a new world that they know nothing about. But keep it in  perspective: A learning center, no matter how wonderful, is only one experience  out of many at the disposal of homeschoolers. Employ it as a tool if you find  it useful, but don&rsquo;t mistake it for more than it is — a network for sure, and  in many cases, a school in different garb.</p>
                 <p>The use of museums, businesses, and learning centers that market  to homeschoolers can drain homeschoolers&rsquo; time and motivation for putting into  the kind of community building I have described. It&rsquo;s so easy for newbies to  get scooped up by exciting programming and glossy packaging that they never  find out about everything else that&rsquo;s possible, and in the long run,  unwittingly change the face of homeschooling from its vast diversity and  possibilities to a face that looks a lot more like school. Maybe alternative  school, but still, school.</p>
                 <p>There are some things—family time, community, freedom—that are so  true and basic, they are worth protecting and holding onto. It used to be we  didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to nurture those things, and now I know how lucky we  were.</p>
