	       <h1>Behind the Scenes at AHEM: Amy Faeskorn</h1>
	       <p>This series profiles the volunteer board members of AHEM who answer your <a href="../../one-on-one.html">phone calls and emails</a>; keep the AHEM website updated; follow MA legislation; maintain the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=lwP373yb5gBQFElJgDNE7A_3d_3d">homeschool policy and practice database</a>; and dream up and make happen events and programs like <em>Fall Fair, Spring Fling, Getting Started Homeschooling</em> workshops, regional coops, and the <a href="../../podcast.html"><em>Slow Homeschooling</em> podcast</a>. </p>

		   <p>Amy lives in Swampscott with her husband, daughter, son, and  West Highland White Terrier. She discovered the writings of John Taylor Gatto  in 2001 while teaching English as a Second Language in the Boston Public  Schools and was forever changed by them. Her two children have been  homeschooled since 2006. Her family embraces an unschooling philosophy, which  teaches her a lot about loving children for who they are and who they will  become. She appreciates how homeschooling allows her family to learn, grow, and  live together at home and out in the world.</p>
              
              <p>Amy had the pleasure of meeting John Taylor Gatto at a  conference in 2011, at which time he signed her dog-eared copy of <em>A Different  Kind of Teacher</em> and advised her to explore her <q>curiosity cut-offs,</q> which  include American history, improvisation, nonfiction writing, quilting, and  knitting. Although her days of traveling to and living in countries such as  Ecuador, Germany, and Morocco are behind her, she feels most alive when  exploring new places and experiences. She and her family enjoy walking their  dog along the beach just minutes from their house, riding their bicycles,  noodling around on guitar, baking, and questioning just about everything.</p>
              
              <p>Amy has been a volunteer with AHEM since 2013 and a board  member since 2016. She enjoys giving back to an organization that does so much  to inspire and inform and looks forward to continued opportunities to serve  fellow homeschooling families.</p>
