	       <p>This series profiles the volunteer board members of AHEM who answer your <a href="../../one-on-one.html">phone calls and emails</a>; keep the AHEM website updated; follow MA legislation; maintain the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=lwP373yb5gBQFElJgDNE7A_3d_3d">homeschool policy and practice database</a>; and dream up and make happen events and programs like <em>Fall Fair, Spring Fling, Getting Started Homeschooling</em> workshops, regional coops, and the <a href="../../podcast.html"><em>Slow Homeschooling</em> podcast</a>. </p>

	       <p>Milva  lives with her husband in a big old house in Medford, where various dear  friends and adult children come and go on a regular basis. She started  homeschooling her four kids, who range in age from 19 to 33, after her eldest  child’s disappointing time in kindergarten. While that experience led her to  homeschooling, she stayed with it because, well, it’s a wonderful life! Her  family’s active, community-based, child-led style made for a bustling  household, filled with books, music, meetings, lively discussions, and above all,  play. Her home has been the site of countless homeschool support meetings, book  and writing clubs, puppet shows, house concerts, parties, potlucks, and  rehearsals of Shakespeare plays. She enjoys helping others on their  homeschooling paths, so co-founding AHEM in 2003 was a no brainer. She’s led  creative writing workshops for homeschooled kids for many years, and continues  to be inspired by their enthusiasm, creativity, and sparkling individuality.  Milva recorded many of her thoughts and adventures in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2T284Qq" target="_blank">Unschoolers</a>,</em> a work of fiction she  co-authored with Sophia Sayigh, and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XUfEjJ" target="_blank">Slow Homeschooling: Short Essays About Mindful Homeschooling</a>.</em> She continues to  write about homeschooling, unschooling, and education on her blog, <em><a href="https://apotlucklife.com/" target="_blank">A Potluck Life</a></em>.</p>
