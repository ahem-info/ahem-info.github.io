				<h1>Finding College Scholarships &amp; Grants</h1>
<h4>By Bibiana Bautista</h4>
			  <p><em>Editor's note: Please check websites directly to confirm details as this page is not updated regularly.</em></p>
			  <h2 id="gen">General Resources</h2>
<h3 id="fafsa">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</h3> 
<p>To apply for federal student aid, such as federal grants, work-study, and loans, you need to complete the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>. Completing and submitting the FAFSA is free and easier than ever,** and it gives you access to the largest source of financial aid to pay for college or career school.</p>
<p>Many states and colleges use your FAFSA information to determine your eligibility for state and school aid, and some private financial aid providers may use your FAFSA information to determine whether you qualify for their aid.</p> 
<p><em>Editor’s note: The FAFSA has been updated (and hopefully simplified) beginning in 2023. While the application normally is available in August, this year (2023 for the 2024-25 school year) it will not be available until December.</em></p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost of College</h3>  
<p>The <a href="https://phillips-scholarship.org/apply/determining-financial-eligibility/cost-of-college-list/" target="_blank">Phillips Scholarship site</a> helps track estimated costs of attendance (in and out of state rates) including room and board prices across all universities (though information in a financial aid package will be the most reliable final resource).</p> 
<p><em>Editor’s note: When considering college costs, it is important to know that the sticker price is often not what you pay. Schools that list the highest prices also often give the most financial aid and may end up cheaper than schools that post lower costs. Don’t cross a school off your list just because of the sticker price.</em></p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources for Finding Scholarships</h2>
<h3>Office of Financial Assistance</h3> 
<p>MA state resources for grants, tuition waivers, and scholarships from organizations in Massachusetts:</p>

The tabs on <q>MA HS,</q> <q>MA College,</q> and <q>UD/DACA/TPS</q> will be most relevant to MA students.</p>

<h2 id="cautious">Be Cautious</h2> 
<p>With any scholarship you apply for, beware of scams. Be cautious of scholarship search firms that have any of these elements:</p>
<ul class="nested"></ul>
<li>You have to pay a fee</li> 
<li>Money-Back Guarantee</li> 
<li>Asks for social security number</li> 
<li>Credit card/bank account information required</li> 
<li>Offers exclusive information</li> 
<li>Promises cash if you pay the registration fee</li> 
<li>Pay a fee and they guarantee you'll win awards</li> 
<li>Pay a fee and receive a low-interest-rate education loan</li> 
<li>Promises to replace loans with grants if you pay a processing fee</li> 
<p>You can report scholarship scams to the National Fraud Information Center (NFIC) by filing a report online or calling their toll-free hotline at 800-876-7060.</p>
