         <h1>Meet Massachusetts Homeschoolers: The Bautistas</h1>
		   <img src="../../images/bautista.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>by Juan  Bautista</h4>
      <p>As parents we always look for the best for our kids. I remember  not knowing anything about homeschooling but desperately looking for some way  of education other than the conventional routes that are not working and fail  students over and over.</p>
      <p>I remember meeting AHEM parents during a workshop at a hotel in  Danvers, MA, ten years ago. This was a small community of parents hungry to  learn from each other. That was when we found information that inspired and  encouraged us to keep going on this path.</p>
      <p>My daughter Biby is now at UMass-Lowell. She was accepted with  honors and is pursuing a career in Music Education. She started by taking  summer classes just to adapt to college life and to ease her own fears and  ended the program with straight A's. As a homeschooler she was used to learning  one subject for an entire day or reading an entire book for hours till she  finished it, skills she used trying to cover her general education  requirements.</p>
      <p>Biby’s musical dream started at a very young age. As parents we  knew that this would be her path in life, and we couldn't wait for a  conventional school to start teaching music. Unfortunately, they didn’t do that  until the 3rd grade and that would have been a little too late for a child to  begin. We got her enrolled at the <a href="https://cmcb.org/" target="_blank">Community Music Center of Boston (CMCB)</a> at  age 5 and her journey as a musician had begun. The school has over 100 years of  history and is located at the Back Bay in Boston. Biby learned to play the  violin at five years of age. Just five years ago she switched to viola and  began playing in the orchestra. She was part of the <a href="https://www.bostonbeam.org/programs" target="_blank">BEAM</a> program from the beginning. The BEAM  Initiative supports a collaborative effort to provide sustained pathways of  educational opportunity and advanced preparation to Boston-area middle and high  school instrumental musicians from historically underrepresented  communities.</p>
      <p>She was at the music school for over 13 years. Biby has  also gotten the chance to volunteer at different school events with the  community – including an interview with well-known cellist Yo-Yo Ma – and as a  consequence, also got her first job at the front office. Currently she is  working at the school administration (working remotely). Now at UMass-Lowell  she has gotten the chance to work as a teacher assistant for the music  department and to be part of the university orchestra.</p>
      <p>In the future Biby wants to pursue a doctoral degree in music  theory and to work with minorities; the purpose is to have a more diverse  orchestra and ensembles.</p>
      <p>As a parent I always remind my daughter that she's a  <q>homeschooler.</q> She&rsquo;s always been going the extra mile, doing her  best to succeed any time she encounters any challenges or discouragements, when  feeling uncertain or not knowing how to succeed. Meaning you're not the average  student&mdash;you are a homeschooler! You can accomplish anything you work  for.</p>
      <p>I believe my daughter Biby's story as a homeschooler is not  over, since her career is still in the making and she can inspire many kids and  parents to find the resources and most of all the courage to enter and start a  homeschool life.</p>
