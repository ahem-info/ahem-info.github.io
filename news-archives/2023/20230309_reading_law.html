<h1>Reading the Massachusetts Homeschool Laws</h1>
		   
	     <p>At  AHEM, our mission is to empower you as the homeschooling parent. While we  are always happy to talk through issues you may be facing, our goal is to give  you the tools you need to advocate for yourself. The AHEM website is chock full of resources to  help you do just that.</p>
           <p>
As you educate your children, we encourage you to also educate yourself.  Reading through case law may not be something you have ever done before and the  task may seem daunting. We are here to help. Here we talk about  who should read the laws and why, what they consist of, and how to read  them.</p>

<h3>Who and Why</h3>
<p>Some come to homeschooling slowly after years of consideration, others are  thrown into it rather roughly by circumstances beyond their control. If you are  in the latter category, you don’t need to jump right into reading case law. It  is okay to take time to get your feet under you. If you are in this situation,  we have lots of resources to help you get started quickly, including but not  limited to our <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a>.</p>
<p>
If you have been homeschooling for a little while or are considering it for the  future, it is well worth your &nbsp;time to read the laws governing home  education in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>
Why is this important? The first and most obvious reason is that if you are  doing something, especially something a little counter-cultural, that is  governed by law and that comes with certain legal obligations, it is good to  know what those are. The second is that there is a lot of misinformation out  there about homeschooling requirements, both on the side of school districts  and on the side of usually very well-intentioned homeschoolers. If you read the  cases for yourself, you will be better equipped to vet your sources and to  guard yourself against misinformation. Lastly, when you read the law for  yourself, you will be empowered. If your town asks for more, you won&rsquo;t need to  panic but can respond with knowledge and confidence. Often being able to quote  the law to one&rsquo;s school board is enough to get them to back down from  unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>
Ready to begin? Next we will look at what to read, the regulations, and the  major cases governing homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
	<h3>What to read</h3>
	  
	  <p>Massachusetts has no statute that specifically addresses homeschooling. Rather,  homeschooling is governed by case law, in conjunction with applicable statutes.  The following are the major laws and cases which govern homeschooling in the  state.</p>
  <h4>General Laws</h4>
	  <p>There are a few sections of the General Laws of Massachusetts  which are relevant for homeschoolers.</p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.ahem.info/chapter_76.html">Chapter 76, Section 1</a>is known as the  compulsory attendance statute. Most of the details of this section do not apply  to homeschoolers. The relevant sentence in Ch. 76 §1 is that: &ldquo; . . .  such attendance [i.e., in a public or private school] shall not be  required of a child … who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in  advance by the superintendent or the school committee.&rdquo; Homeschoolers in  Massachusetts are &ldquo;otherwise instructed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>
	  In addition, <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter69/Section1D" target="_blank">Chapters 69</a> and<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXII/Chapter71" target="_blank"> 71</a> both list subjects to be covered by public  schools.</p>
  <h4>Major Cases</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.ahem.info/charles.html"><em>The Care and  Protection of Charles</em></a> – The<em> Charles</em> decision, as it is known, is the primary case which governs  homeschooling in Massachusetts. If your reading time is limited, this is the  one to prioritize. The case arises from a situation that began in 1985 in the  town of Canton. At this time there was no guidance for parents or towns as to  what could and couldn&rsquo;t be required of homeschoolers. The school committee  voted to deny the parents permission to educate their children at home. The  case made its way to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts where it was decided in  1987. The court recognized that parents of school age children have the basic  constitutional right to educate their children, and the school committee of the  town in which they reside could protect the State's interest in the education  of its citizens by enforcing, through the approval process, reasonable  requirements, factors that may be considered in determining whether to approve  a home education plan in Massachusetts. <em>Charles</em> and the guidelines it set forth have been referenced in subsequent cases.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.ahem.info/brunelle.html"><em>Michael Brunelle &amp;  Others vs. Lynn Public Schools</em></a> – The <em>Brunelle</em> case was  decided in 1998 and arose when the Lynn School Committee pushed homeschooling  families for home visits as a requirement for approval of home education plans.  The court not only ruled that home visits were unnecessary but also emphasized  the protected right of parents to raise their children without unnecessary  government intrusion on familial privacy and acknowledged the  &ldquo;non-institutional&rdquo; nature of homeschooling.</p>
		   <h3>How to Read</h3>
	     <p>Here are some tips for  reading through the case law the first time:</p>
           
		   <p><strong>Read a summary first.</strong> It can be       helpful to read a summary or condensed version first to get an idea of       what is coming. (In our homeschool we have found this is very true for       Shakespeare–reading a shorter narrative version of a play before seeing it       or reading the original can help get one&rsquo;s bearings.) AHEM provides       summaries of the <em><a href="../../charles.html">Charles</a></em></a> and <em><a href="../../brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></a></em> decisions to get       you started.</p>
             <p><strong>Look at the big picture and       notice what sections there are in the case.</strong> Legal decisions are written in       a certain way and if we know what to expect, we will be able to work our       way through more easily. It may be helpful to print out the case and to       mark off the sections.</p>
	<p>In general, expect to find the following       sections:</p>
             <ul class="nested">
               <li>Identifying information,        including case numbers and dates</li>
               <li>A summary of the decision</li>
               <li>A history of the case, i.e.        how the parties got to be before the court</li>
               <li>A discussion of the issues,        perhaps including arguments from both sides</li>
               <li>The decision(s) of the court</li>
             </ul>
           
           <p>Understanding these different sections can  help us avoid potential confusion. For instance, the discussion section may  include arguments from both sides but these are not necessarily the opinions of  the court. On the other hand, seeing what issues and factors the court  considered may give some insight into how they might decide future cases.</p>
           
             <p><strong>Read with an open mind.</strong>       Understandably, many homeschoolers value minimal governmental intrusion       into what they consider parental decisions. While the <em>Charles</em> court       recognized parents’ rights in determining how their children will be       educated, it also acknowledged the state’s interest in the education of       its citizenry. The decision seeks to balance these two interests.</p>       </main>
