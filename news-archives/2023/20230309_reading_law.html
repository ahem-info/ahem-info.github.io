<h1>Reading the Massachusetts Homeschool Laws</h1>
		   
	     <p>At  AHEM, our mission is to empower you as the homeschooling parent. While we  are always happy to talk through issues you may be facing, our goal is to give  you the tools you need to advocate for yourself. The AHEM website is chock full of resources to  help you do just that.</p>
           <p>
As you educate your children, we encourage you to also educate yourself.  Reading through case law may not be something you have ever done before and the  task may seem daunting. We are here to help. In this short series we talk about  who should read the laws and why, what they consist of, and how to read  them.</p>

<h3>Who and Why</h3>
<p>Some come to homeschooling slowly after years of consideration, others are  thrown into it rather roughly by circumstances beyond their control. If you are  in the latter category, you don’t need to jump right into reading case law. It  is okay to take time to get your feet under you. If you are in this situation,  we have lots of resources to help you get started quickly, including but not  limited to our <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a>.</p>
<p>
If you have been homeschooling for a little while or are considering it for the  future, it is well worth your &nbsp;time to read the laws governing home  education in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>
Why is this important? The first and most obvious reason is that if you are  doing something, especially something a little counter-cultural, that is  governed by law and that comes with certain legal obligations, it is good to  know what those are. The second is that there is a lot of misinformation out  there about homeschooling requirements, both on the side of school districts  and on the side of usually very well-intentioned homeschoolers. If you read the  cases for yourself, you will be better equipped to vet your sources and to  guard yourself against misinformation. Lastly, when you read the law for  yourself, you will be empowered. If your town asks for more, you won&rsquo;t need to  panic but can respond with knowledge and confidence. Often being able to quote  the law to one&rsquo;s school board is enough to get them to back down from  unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>
Ready to begin? Next we will look at what to read, the regulations, and the  major cases governing homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
