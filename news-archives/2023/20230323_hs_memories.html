         <h1>Your Best Homeschooling Memories</h1>
           <h2>Inspiration from Your Fellow Homeschoolers</h2>
           <p>Last month we asked you to share with us your best  homeschooling memories  -- field trips,  books, projects, and just snapshots from daily life. So many of you responded  that it is going to take us at least two newsletters-worth to share all your  wonderful responses. A big thank you to all who contributed. We at AHEM were  inspired and we hope that you will be too. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Endless days at the pool and our favorite parks&rdquo;<br>
           – my Five</p>
         <p>&ldquo;My favorite memory of homeschooling my son is a field trip  to a local park for a science lesson! He loved being outside and in nature for  school!&rdquo;<br>
           – Andrea from Gardner</p>
         <p>&ldquo;When my in-laws, who are public school and were suspicious  of homeschooling, told me I was doing an amazing job, and bragged to others  about it.&rdquo;<br>
           – Lizzie from Framingham</p>
         <p>&ldquo;When the children became frustrated when they couldn&rsquo;t find  an answer, I would quietly and firmly say, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s find it together.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
           – Homeschool Grandmother</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;We created a small home school pod -3 families, 6 kids all  around matching ages. Each family subscribed to the snack box subscription  Universal Yums. Each month the snacks came from a different country. The group  learned about the country:climate, history, food, location on the map, etc.  Each family cooked food from the country of the month and shared-while each  child shared a presentation on something they were interested in from that  country in an oral presentation. We ended our monthly meetup by tasting our  snacks and grading them from best to worst, reading the pamphlet in the box  about the snacks and other info on the location. Sometimes our new country  discoveries would take us to local restaurants with food from the country or we  would visit a local art museum and find artwork or artifacts from the country.  Sometimes the kids would interview friends from the country of study, etc. The  coop went on for 2 years. Such a great enriching experience- the kids all  choose interesting things from the country. We all learned a ton of info. My  kids still talk about it 3 years later. What a great way to tie in multiple  educational subjects (foreign language, culinary arts, writing, reading,  research, geography, science, presentation and public speaking skills, travel  and tourism skills, etc).&rdquo;<br>
           – Jill S. from Boston</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Our most treasured homeschooling memory is the unhurried  morning snuggles reading the Bible and learning about God.&rdquo;<br>
           – Aimee from Billerica</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Yesterday we went to Appleton Farms in Hamilton to see how  trees are tapped for maple syrup. Then we came home and read about maple syrup  making in Little House in the Big Woods…and we ate biscuits with maple syrup!&rdquo;<br>
           – Rebecca M.</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;Field trips to museums and attending lectures at our  library.&rdquo;<br>
           – Colleen C. of Shrewsbury</p>
         <p>&ldquo;The best part of homeschooling is that you can completely  focus in one area that you will be working on your skills set for life. Like my  daughter now to be on the path for Music Ed. (&quot;You can just finish reading  more than one book all day&quot;). My daughter's words.&rdquo;<br>
           – Juan Bautista, Dad of a wonderful homeschooler soon-to-be  college student admitted with honors!</p>
         <p>&ldquo;The enormous amount of time I get to be with my children ❤️&rdquo;<br>

           <p>
  &ldquo;It was during Covid lockdown (pretty much the entire year  of 2021 in Thailand.) My son and I would travel places together using the magic  key we came up with. And we had so so much fun exploring the endless world of  imagination inside our tiny playroom at home. We went to Mars, International  Space Station, Dubai, flew an Airbus, and even traveled back in time, to name a  few.&rdquo;<br>
           – Varisara</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Running the Homeschoolers Magic Club and putting on magic  shows for local groups.&rdquo;<br>
           – Pat from Medford</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Reading aloud together; particularly the Little House on  the Prairie series, and Because of Winn Dixie.&rdquo;<br>
           – Kelly from Middleboro</p>
         <p>&ldquo;My best memory is also my saddest. Our family lost a son by  suicide in October of 2020. We had started homeschooling our youngest three in  September of 2020. The 2020-2021 school year was incredibly hard but also a  blessed gift for us. Even though our son was a Senior in highschool, our actual  school system never reached out to us with any kind of condolence. Our son was  in a Vocational school, but still under our town school system. If our children  had been in school, their grieving would have been limited to one week off.  Homeschooling allowed us plenty of time to work through our grief and even find  different programs and other homeschoolers that we could be networked with.  Once we saw how much freedom, expansion of life and incredible love  homeschooling could build in our family we decided we would never want to go  back to regular school. In the past few years, we have connected with many  homeschoolers who have also lost children. Homeschooling allows our children to  not be pushed into the rush of life and gives us the freedom to take life as it  comes.&rdquo;<br>

  &ldquo;Teaching my son to make a home-made lunch for both of us to  share.&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;Traveling- so far we have visited Washington DC,  Pennsylvania (to see the groundhog), camping in Maine and New Hampshire,  England, and Alaska. We have tickets for Colorado in April and a flight to  Washington state to start a cross country trip back home to the East Coast in  June!&rdquo;<br>
           – Julie C. from Massachusetts</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Groups:plays/ drama, felting projects. Playing in the woods  with 5 nine year old boys for the winter.&rdquo;<br>
           – Claudine</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;We'd all climb into a beech tree to sit on its wide  branches, lean up against its strong trunk, and listen the wind, birds, and  insects while I read nature stories.&rdquo;<br>
           – Anonymous</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Learning about butterfly life cycles and taking a trip to  Deerfield to see it all in action. We had just as much fun as the kids and  learned a bunch too!&rdquo;<br>
           – The Monteiro family</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Field trip to a historical mansion at Christmas time and  the mansion was covered it snow. The curators had wonderful Victorian  activities for the kids to do.&rdquo;<br>
           – Anonymous</p>
         <p>&ldquo;The two oldest kids did state reports, then helped to plan  vacations to visit those states. Best family road-trip vacation we ever had!  I&rsquo;m looking forward to repeating this project next year with the two middle  kids.&rdquo;<br>
           – Karen L., mom of 5</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;My favorite memory so far is when my child was doing math  and started getting very excited because they finally grasped a concept they  couldn&rsquo;t while in public school. My second favorite is when my youngest started  to learn to read she sounded out the word Mars. Reading was the subject I was  intimidated to teach. I love just having my kids at home and experiencing these  milestones with them versus a stranger teaching them.&rdquo;<br>
           – Sarah B.</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Being part of a homeschool co-op with families who share  our faith&rdquo;<br>
           – Jen L. from Upton</p>
         <p>&ldquo;Homeschool field trips have been a huge win for us because  my son was too anxious to enjoy field trips in school. We also had a  wonderfully memorable homeschool day yesterday, baking Irish scones with his  grandparents — measuring, fractions, chemistry, culture, reading,  communication, life skills..it was a beautiful day.&rdquo;<br>
           – Allie C.</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;The day we measured the length of the Titanic down our  street. It was a great way to visualize 883 feet!!&rdquo;<br>
           – Rachel from Framingham</p>
         <p>&ldquo;My favorite memories are my sons teaching me something  they&rsquo;ve learned or observed on their own or we&rsquo;ve learned together. Every  Spring my youngest and I forage greens for a wild greens pizza. He likes to  research the nutritional value of each plant and to learn how to identify them.  Last year my son became interested in baking. So, for May 1 my son and I picked  dandelions and learned how to make dandelion and lemon cupcakes. He had to  convert the recipe from grams to ounces because it was from a German baker.  When I accidentally added too much flour, my son figured out the correct ratios  in order to proportion up the other ingredients instead of scratching the whole  project and starting over.&rdquo;<br>
           – M from Groton</p>

  &ldquo;Just being with my kids every single day&rdquo;<br>
