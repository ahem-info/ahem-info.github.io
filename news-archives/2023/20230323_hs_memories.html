         <h1>Your Best Homeschooling Memories</h1>
           <h2>Inspiration from Your Fellow Homeschoolers</h2>
           <p>We asked you to share with us your best  homeschooling memories&mdash;field trips,  books, projects, and just snapshots from daily life. So many of you responded  that it is going to take us at least two newsletters-worth to share all your  wonderful responses. A big thank you to all who contributed. We at AHEM were  inspired and we hope that you will be too. </p>
	    <p>&ldquo;Spending time        every day with my kids&rdquo;<br>
		                 – <em>Shannon D., MA mom        of 4</em></p>
		                 
		                 <p>&ldquo;So many..... LOVED Geography club.        Monthly meeting with about 10 other families where each participant        created a project to share with the group relating to the culture of the        Country we chose and we all made food from that country and we had a        wonderful art class each meeting to learn about the art of that country        and listened to the music. It was so fun. We did that for about 7 years.&rdquo;<br>

		                 <p>&ldquo;Riding in the car to any homeschool        event and talking about life, the cosmos, theories, friendship skills, and        on and on.&rdquo;<br>

		                   <p>&ldquo;With 20+ years        of homeschooling behind us, it&rsquo;s impossible to choose just one treasured        memory. But one of many that stands out is the homeschool book group we        participated in for many years. We read so many great books, and had        wonderful discussions and accompanying activities. Our meetings were held        in libraries, or each other&rsquo;s homes, and many were held outside in the        fresh air, with lots of free play afterward.&rdquo;<br>
		                   – <em>J. C.</em></p>
		                 <p>&ldquo;This year I watched my child doing a        presentation on a science project, and I realized how much growth and        improvement had occurred! The confidence, the attitude, the language—I        could barely recognize her!&rdquo;<br>

		                   <p>&ldquo;Reading with my kids&rdquo;<br>
		                     <em>- Mom</em> </p>
		                   <p>
		                   &ldquo;Traveling, camping, museum days, long days spent reading all snuggled up        together while the weather raged, and thoughtful dinner conversations.        The closeness of my two boys to one another and their frequent puns        shared. Our favorite memories are the ability to explore the world and        our individual and shared interests all together in a vibrant medley of        ways.&rdquo;<br>
		                   <em>- The Adventurers</em></p>
		                   
		                   <p>&ldquo;A few years        ago, we borrowed a book from the library called Smart About the        Presidents. My two oldest children thumbed through the pages for weeks.        Then, without any prompting from us, they came up with a quiz game they        called &ldquo;The Presidents Game.&rdquo; Through this quizzing of each other, the        two of them learned all of the presidents, in order, along with their        accompanying life facts. It&rsquo;s a prime example of something that was        completely unschooled but will stick with them forever.&rdquo;<br>
		                   <em>- Meredith</em></p>
		                   
		                   <p>&ldquo;Every time my child is able to spend the whole day building a creative        project of her own invention that sprawls all over the dining room floor,        or spend the whole day outside in any season, is a treasured memory.&rdquo;<br>
		                   <em>– S in Western Mass</em></p>
		                   <p>
		                   &ldquo;Because our family's focus is so much about learning on a daily basis,        every family vacation becomes a fascination. Everywhere and anywhere we        travel to becomes an inquisitive journey for the entire family. Learning        all we can about the location and the history of its significance. Every        place we explore now is fulfilling in a way that far exceeds how we        previously experienced the world prior to home education&rdquo;<br>

		                   &ldquo;So far my favorite thus far is when my son started taking Fencing        training and the minute they put on his uniform he had a huge smile and        pure happiness in his eyes.&rdquo;<br>
		                   – <em>Heidi H. from        Salisbury</em></p>
		                   <p>
		                   &ldquo;All the time I get to spend with my daughter. From the rough days to the        good days. I really can't pick just one thing. It's brought us closer        together as a family and it feels more natural to have my daughter by my        side as she grows and learns.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
		                   –<em> Victoria S.</em></p>

		                   <p>
		                   &ldquo;Everything about homeschooling is my most treasured memory. I started        homeschooling during COVID and I never thought I could do this but We got        this now! We learn in every way. I love taking them to the museum along        with all the other trips we take. One of the best books I&rsquo;ve read as a        family is the Bible. We teach them the basic foundation and principles        they need. It is an honor to be present in each day of my children&rsquo;s        development.&rdquo;<br>

		                   <p>
		                   &ldquo;I'm done        homeschooling, but my memories linger. The most precious, actually, are        the ones where my older children thanked me for what I'd done. Having        young adults appreciate the sacrifice and work done on their behalf is        priceless.&rdquo;</strong><br>

		                   &ldquo;I have so many treasured memories! Our family trips, especially our trip        to Fort Ticonderoga. We all love when we sit together while I read to        them. Watching my children learn how to read has been so special. This is        just to name a few.&rdquo;<br>

Reading the Green Ember series late into the night with no        worries about having to get up early to get to school on time!

		                   &ldquo;Being there to watch my daughter        connect the dots of things that troubled her in school and watching her        confidence burst as she learns, knowing that she was never &lsquo;bad&rsquo; at it        but lacked the confidence to motivate her.&rdquo;<br>

		                   &ldquo;For several        years, I ran a homeschoolers' project fair at our local library. It was        relatively easy to plan, and I loved seeing the kids' enthusiasm for        learning come shining through as they talked with visitors about their        projects - their inspirations, their challenges, and their        accomplishments. It was a precious opportunity to celebrate independent        learning in community.&rdquo;<br>

		                   &ldquo;My favorite        homeschooling memory came when the kids were about 10 and 6. It was late        August and we went to Kmart to buy a single school supply. (I took a        picture that day of a sign in the store that said &quot;School supply&quot;).        The parking lot was crowded and I wondered why. I really started        wondering why the store was so crowded once we got in the store. The        school supply we came for? A kite. We got our kite and got in line at the        register. People in front of me and behind me had carts of pencils,        notebooks, etc. That's when I realized why the store was crowded. Back to        school shopping! We were the only ones with no pencils or notebooks but a        single kite. I love that memory! (We studied wind patterns with our        kite).&rdquo;<br>

		                 <p>&ldquo;A couple times        a winter we go feed the birds at a nearby Audubon center. We hold out        seeds in our bare hands and the birds come and snatch seeds from us.        Watching my children stand stock still in the cold, waiting for the        flutter of wings and tiny claws to grasp their fingers, I am seeing in        them an awe and love of the natural world. This kind of field trip        creates a permanent curiosity about and love for the world around us,        that fuels a desire to study and learn more than any test score or grade        could do. I'm so glad we've had these quiet times in the woods as a family!&rdquo;<br>

They feel confident, smart, self-assured and capable. They        always feel badly for traditionally schooled kids!

         <p>&ldquo;When the children became frustrated when they couldn&rsquo;t find  an answer, I would quietly and firmly say, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s find it together.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
           – Homeschool Grandmother</p>
           <p>
  &ldquo;We created a small home school pod -3 families, 6 kids all  around matching ages. Each family subscribed to the snack box subscription  Universal Yums. Each month the snacks came from a different country. The group  learned about the country:climate, history, food, location on the map, etc.  Each family cooked food from the country of the month and shared-while each  child shared a presentation on something they were interested in from that  country in an oral presentation. We ended our monthly meetup by tasting our  snacks and grading them from best to worst, reading the pamphlet in the box  about the snacks and other info on the location. Sometimes our new country  discoveries would take us to local restaurants with food from the country or we  would visit a local art museum and find artwork or artifacts from the country.  Sometimes the kids would interview friends from the country of study, etc. The  coop went on for 2 years. Such a great enriching experience- the kids all  choose interesting things from the country. We all learned a ton of info. My  kids still talk about it 3 years later. What a great way to tie in multiple  educational subjects (foreign language, culinary arts, writing, reading,  research, geography, science, presentation and public speaking skills, travel  and tourism skills, etc).&rdquo;<br>

  &ldquo;It was during Covid lockdown (pretty much the entire year  of 2021 in Thailand.) My son and I would travel places together using the magic  key we came up with.

We went to Mars, International  Space Station, Dubai, flew an Airbus, and even traveled back in time, to name a  few.&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;My best memory is also my saddest. Our family lost a son by  suicide in October of 2020. We had started homeschooling our youngest three in  September of 2020. The 2020-2021 school year was incredibly hard but also a  blessed gift for us. Even though our son was a Senior in highschool, our actual  school system never reached out to us with any kind of condolence. Our son was  in a Vocational school, but still under our town school system. If our children  had been in school, their grieving would have been limited to one week off.  Homeschooling allowed us plenty of time to work through our grief and even find  different programs and other homeschoolers that we could be networked with.  Once we saw how much freedom, expansion of life and incredible love  homeschooling could build in our family we decided we would never want to go  back to regular school. In the past few years, we have connected with many  homeschoolers who have also lost children. Homeschooling allows our children to  not be pushed into the rush of life and gives us the freedom to take life as it  comes.&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;Field trip to a historical mansion at Christmas time and  the mansion was covered it snow. The curators had wonderful Victorian  activities for the kids to do.&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;The two oldest kids did state reports, then helped to plan  vacations to visit those states. Best family road-trip vacation we ever had!  I&rsquo;m looking forward to repeating this project next year with the two middle  kids.&rdquo;<br>

  &ldquo;My favorite memory so far is when my child was doing math  and started getting very excited because they finally grasped a concept they  couldn&rsquo;t while in public school. My second favorite is when my youngest started  to learn to read she sounded out the word Mars. Reading was the subject I was  intimidated to teach. I love just having my kids at home and experiencing these  milestones with them versus a stranger teaching them.&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;Homeschool field trips have been a huge win for us because  my son was too anxious to enjoy field trips in school. We also had a  wonderfully memorable homeschool day yesterday, baking Irish scones with his  grandparents — measuring, fractions, chemistry, culture, reading,  communication, life skills..it was a beautiful day.&rdquo;<br>

  &ldquo;The day we measured the length of the Titanic down our  street. It was a great way to visualize 883 feet!!&rdquo;<br>

         <p>&ldquo;My favorite memories are my sons teaching me something  they&rsquo;ve learned or observed on their own or we&rsquo;ve learned together. Every  Spring my youngest and I forage greens for a wild greens pizza. He likes to  research the nutritional value of each plant and to learn how to identify them.  Last year my son became interested in baking. So, for May 1 my son and I picked  dandelions and learned how to make dandelion and lemon cupcakes. He had to  convert the recipe from grams to ounces because it was from a German baker.  When I accidentally added too much flour, my son figured out the correct ratios  in order to proportion up the other ingredients instead of scratching the whole  project and starting over.&rdquo;<br>
