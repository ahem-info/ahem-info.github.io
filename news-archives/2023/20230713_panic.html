<h1>Step One: DON'T PANIC</h1>
<p>The guidebook known as  <em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (from the novel of the same name) is said  to have on its cover these words: DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</p>
  <p>If I were making a guidebook on homeschool reporting, I  would take a page (pun intended) from Douglas Adams and start the same  way.</p>
  <p>Maybe your town has a new homeschool policy. Maybe they are  making requests they never have before. Maybe instead of approving your  education plan, they are asking for more information. Maybe you are just new  and nervous about sending in your first education plan.</p>
  <p>Whatever your situation, the first step is the  same:<strong> DON&rsquo;T PANIC.</strong></p>
  <p>What you do next may depend upon your circumstances, but here  are some suggestions (in no particular order):</p>
<ul class="nested">
  <li>Breathe.</li>
  <li><a href="../../ma_hs_law.html">Review the law</a> and <a href="../../tips.html">familiarize yourself with what your town can require</a>.</li>
<li>If you are reporting       for the first time, check out the many resources on AHEM’s website, especially our <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a>.</li>
  <li>If your town is       asking for more detail, reread what they have sent you. Make a list of       what they are actually asking for so that you can think about and address       each issue. You may find that a lot of words are overshadowing just one or       two actual requests.</li>
  <li>If your town is       asking for a form or application to be filled out, read <a href="../2021/20210716_forms.html">Conform to Forms</a>.</li>
  <li>If your town has a       new policy that seems intimidating (or just plain wrong), read <a href="../../hs_policies.html">our article on homeschool policies</a>.</li>
  <li>Reach out to others       in your district to see if they are having similar issues and to make a       plan for a unified response.</li>
  <li>Reach out to       experienced homeschoolers you can trust.</li>
  <li>Consider doing       nothing. If you have approval or you are not actually being asked for       anything specific, sometimes the right response is just to ignore what has       been sent.</li>
  <li>Ask for       clarification. If your town is asking for more information, be sure you       understand what they want. It may be that they are satisfied with less       than you would expect.</li>
  <li>Try giving them the       same information in a different format. It may be that sending your       progress report in the form of a report card or organizing your materials       by subject is enough to satisfy them.</li>
  <li>Ramp up slowly. If       your town is asking for more detail, try giving a little more at a       time.</li>
  <li>Be polite. You are       likely dealing with an administrator who has a lot of balls they are       juggling. A little civility can go a long way.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t assume the       worst and don&rsquo;t assume that your town knows the law. With only a few, rare       exceptions, most school administrators are not out to get homeschoolers.       If the things they are asking for seem to go beyond what is legally       required, it is likely because they just don&rsquo;t know the law very well, if       at all.</li>
