		<p>As their neighbors buy new lunch boxes and notebooks and worry about adjusting sleep schedules and who's going to get junior off the bus this year, many homeschoolers find themselves breathing a sigh of relief. Finally, our favorite museums and parks will be less crowded again! Whether you stick to the traditional school-year calendar or take a more free-form approach, the end of summer is the perfect time to get outdoors and to fully enjoy the flexibility that homeschooling affords. Not-back-to-school events are a way to connect with others and to celebrate the freedom that homeschooling gives.</p> 

<p>In the sidebar is a list of not-back-to-school events in Massachusetts. If there is not one near you, consider creating your own. It can be as simple as picking a day and location and inviting a few friends. Let us know&mdash;we would be happy to add it to the list!
</p>
	<p>And finally, before you go enjoy the uncrowded outdoors, a favorite "not-back-to-school" memory from Carrie in Somerville:
<blockquote><em>“My favorite homeschooling memory came when the kids were about 10 and 6. It was late August and we went to Kmart to buy a single school supply. (I took a picture that day of a sign in the store that said "School supply"). The parking lot was crowded and I wondered why. I really started wondering why the store was so crowded once we got in the store. The school supply we came for? A kite. We got our kite and got in line at the register. People in front of me and behind me had carts of pencils, notebooks, etc. That's when I realized why the store was crowded. Back to school shopping! We were the only ones with no pencils or notebooks but a single kite. I love that memory! (We studied wind patterns with our kite).”</em></blockquote>
