		   <h2>Bill regarding access to the MCAS exam </h2>
         <h4><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H506" target="_blank">H.506</a></h4>
         <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO THE MCAS EXAM by Bradley H. Jones, Jr. - 20th Middlesex </p>
         <ul class="nested">
			 <li>2/16/2023 House Referred to the Joint committee on Education</li>
         <li>2/16/2023 Senate concurred</li>
                  </ul>
<p>SECTION 1. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department of elementary and secondary education shall issue a report on the feasibility and costs associated with non-public school students and home-schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily taking the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exam; provided that said report shall be provided to the secretary of administration and finance, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, and the clerks of the senate and house of representatives who shall forward the same to the chair of the senate ways and means committee, the chair of the house ways and means committee, and the house and senate chairs of the joint committee on education within 6 months of the effective date of this act.
</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: Would issue a report on allowing private and homeschooled students to take the MCAS. AHEM contacted Rep. Jones and asked that “and home schooled students” be removed from the language of the bill, as homeschoolers are included in the category “non-public school students” and introducing the term “home schooled” into statutory language begs for it to be defined.</em></p>
         <p><em>AHEM position: If language is amended, neutral.</em></p>

                  <h2>Bills regarding community college tuition</h2>
         <h4><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S1233" target="_blank">S.1233</a></h4>
         <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION by John Velis - Hampden and Hampshire</p>
<ul class="nested">         
<li>2/16/2023 Senate Referred to the Joint committee on Labor and Workforce Development</li>
         <li>2/16/2023 House concurred</li>
                  </ul>
<p>(1) To be eligible for the scholarship a student shall be admitted to, and enrolled full-time in, an eligible postsecondary program within five years following graduation, not including time spent in the United States Armed Forces, from an eligible high school in Massachusetts, or completion of high school as a Massachusetts home school student, or obtaining a GED® or HiSET® diploma.
</p>
<p><em>Summary: This bill would create the Massachusetts Workforce Opportunity Scholarship. The problem with it is that it introduces the term “home school” into law, and would require defining what qualifies as completion of high school. AHEM has contacted Senator Velis and asked him to consider amending the language to not include the term “home school”.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM position: Neutral, if language is changed.</em></p>
		   <p>AHEM will continue to monitor these and any additional bills that may be filed during the 193rd Session that could affect homeschooling in Massachusetts.</p>
