<h1>Field Trip Survey Results, Part 1:
Museums &amp; History
</h1>
	     <p>Recently we asked      for your field trip suggestions across New England. Many of you responded,      telling us your favorites and your hidden gems. Since we got so many good      responses, we will present the information in two sections. Today we begin      with museums, historical sites, and more. Stay tuned for everything science      and nature in a future edition.</p>
		            
		            <h2>How often do you go?</h2>
		            
		            <p>One of the biggest advantages of homeschooling is the freedom it gives to      explore new places, and to do so at off-peak hours. So how often are      homeschoolers in Massachusetts getting out there? We found that there is      really a range&mdash;80% of you are getting out there anywhere from once a week      to once a quarter. Some only manage a field trip a few times a year (15%)      but some diehards (5%) are getting out more than once a week!</p>
		            
		            <h2>Where do you go?</h2>
		            <p>
		            With history all around us, lots of natural beauty, and tons of culture,      there is no shortage of field trip options in New England. So where are you      going?</p>
		            <p>
		            <h3>Most Recommendations</h3>
		            <p>The big winner in our survey, with 10 votes, was the living      history museum Old Sturbridge Village (OSV) in Sturbridge, Massachusetts.      OSV is a reconstructed 1830s-era village which also has regular homeschool      days.</p>
		            <h3>Top Museums</h3>
		            <p>A number of museums made our list. Some of your favorites      were:</p>
