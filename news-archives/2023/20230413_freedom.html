         <h1>Maintaining Homeschool Freedom</h1>
		   <h3>What&rsquo;s at  stake?</h3>
           <p>Homeschooling is still  sometimes misunderstood by conventional educators, legislators, homeschoolers&rsquo;  friends and relatives, and the general public. Homeschooling is not school at  home. That is not why it works or what makes it valuable. The strength of  homeschooling is that it allows a diversity of families to teach theirchildren in the way  that is best for them, with the flexibility to meet children&rsquo;s changing needs.</p>
           <p>Would a&nbsp;statute serve us better than the current case law?  Why can&rsquo;t all homeschoolers in Massachusetts participate in school activities?  Shouldn&rsquo;t we get vouchers or tax credits to defray the cost of homeschooling?  Below, we consider whether these ideas would expand or diminish homeschooling  freedom.</p>
  <h3>Replace case law with a homeschool statute</h3>
           <p>Some say a statute would better standardize the way schools and  homeschoolers interact across the state. While it is true that there is some  variation in how the Charles guidelines are executed town by town, the  guidelines themselves remain unchanged. &nbsp;Overall it is still very easy and  straightforward to homeschool in most towns in Massachusetts.</p>
           <p>If a statute were to be written, legislators and educators would  have as much or more influence over its creation than homeschoolers, a scenario  likely to lead to more restrictions, not fewer. Homeschooling regulations  intended to make home schools more like conventional schools would interfere  with the flexibility needed for homeschooling to be an effective alternative to  conventional school.</p>
  
           <p>Another often overlooked factor is that the local oversight of homeschooling  that Charles delineates gives homeschooling parents more power in influencing  school officials and elected officials such as school committee members.</p>
  <h3>Right of homeschoolers to use school facilities</h3>
           <p>Local control also means that local schools can decide what  services homeschoolers can access. The school does not receive funding for your  unenrolled child if you homeschool, which dilutes the argument that some  homeschoolers make about why they should be able to access school programs. Of  course, all citizens pay taxes whether or not they use the public schools. See <em><a href="../../public_school_participation.html">Participation in Public Schools</a></em>.</p>
  <h3>Vouchers and tax credits</h3>
           <p>Some argue that homeschoolers should be eligible for tax  credits, vouchers, or school choice funds. It&rsquo;s important to remember that when  the government provides programs, services, or financial benefits, it reasonably  expects accountability. With accountability comes definitions, in this case the  need to define what homeschooling is and what it is not. What activities and  materials are &ldquo;educational&rdquo; would have to be determined. As with proposed  legislation, the likelihood is that the definitions would mirror the practices  of conventional schools, setting us off on the slippery slope to restricting  homeschooling freedom.</p>
  <h3>The future</h3>
           <p>The right to homeschool is an option that allows families to  organize their lives on a predictable schedule that is suited to their own  needs. We have heard from many families that witnessing the blossoming of their  children without the constraints of conventional school has proven an  unexpected joy. It is important for that personalized, flexible option to be  available to all families, all the time, just as the choice to go to school is  available to all homeschoolers at any time.</p>
           <p>We hope AHEM has been a help to you in homeschooling, and we ask  in return that whether you choose school or homeschool in the future, you will  understand and support our mission to maintain the right for families to  independently homeschool with the most freedom possible in Massachusetts.</p>
