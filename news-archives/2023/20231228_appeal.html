<p>Thank you so much if you've already responded to our year-end appeal. If you haven't there's still time to make a <a href="../../support.html">2023 tax-deductible donation</a> to AHEM! Read on...</p>
<p>Dear AHEM Friends,</p>
  <p>Twenty years ago, on the floor of a gymnasium during indoor  homeschool gym time, AHEM was brought to life by a group of passionate  homeschooling mothers with the goal to maintain the right to independently  homeschool and strengthen the grassroots presence of homeschoolers in  Massachusetts.</p>
  <p>AHEM’s specific ways of serving its mission have evolved, shaped  by the interests of <a href="../../about.html">those at the helm</a>, while taking into  consideration the changing needs and desires of Massachusetts homeschoolers –  YOU!</p>
  <p>Core endeavors from day one have included:</p>
<ul class="nested">
  <li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FXGKFH8">A policy and practice database</a> to identify trends and answer questions with evidence-based responses.</li>
  <li><a href="20230928_leg_update.html">A legislative watch</a> to monitor bills and inform you when one pertinent to homeschooling in Massachusetts arises.</li>
  <li>Educating the public and supporting Massachusetts homeschoolers </li>
  <ul class="nested">
    <li><a href="../../index.html">AHEM.info</a> is the go-to source for        homeschooling in Massachusetts. Whether it’s getting started or        understanding state law our comprehensive website is there for you. Our <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a> and <a href="../../sample_progress_report.html">progress report</a> help streamline the        approval process, allowing you to spend more time on homeschooling and        less on paperwork.</li>
    <li><a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v">Email updates</a> provide information about        events, legislative issues, and helpful essays about the homeschooling        lifestyle.</li>
    <li><a href="../../one-on-one.html">One-on-one communication and support</a> because        sometimes you need more than a screen full of information. AHEM        representatives are available every day to address your specific        questions and concerns.</li>
    <li><a href="../../news.html">Programs</a> offering face-to-face support.        Because all the technology in the world can’t replace the value of human        connection.</li>
    <li><a href="../../networking.html">Connecting local homeschoolers</a> through        our Town Point People, the AHEM Networking Forum, and local support group        listings.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>In 2020 the homeschooling population exploded, more than  doubling in size. AHEM rose to the challenge, orienting many people who started  homeschooling against their will, providing over 20 virtual homeschooling  presentations, articles to help this specific population get started, and ways  to connect with others when getting together in real life was not possible.</p>
  <p>The number of Massachusetts homeschoolers is estimated to have  increased 55% since 2017-2018. Yet some things stay the same: Twenty years on,  the resources that help support homeschooling families like you still come from  committed, knowledgeable homeschooling parents like AHEM volunteers.</p>
  <p>Help AHEM continue to provide the reliable quality service  you’ve come to expect. <a href="../../support.html">AHEM depends on donations from homeschoolers like you</a> to keep bringing you our website, survey results, free counseling, legislative  watch, and programming. As the year draws to a close, <a href="../../support.html">please consider a tax-deductible donation of any amount  so we can continue to work for you!</a></p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br>
  <em>Sophia Sayigh</em><br>
  Volunteer board member 2003 - 2023</p>
