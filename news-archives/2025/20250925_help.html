<h1>AHEM Needs You!</h1>

<p>Over the past few weeks, we have shared a bit about what AHEM does and the impact on our MA homeschool community (<a href="20250828_leg.html">Legislative Watch</a>, <a href="20250911_ed.html">Education</a>, <a href="20250918_support.html">One-on-One Support</a>).</p>

<p>AHEM isn’t a large corporate entity with a huge support staff, a multimillion-dollar budget, or a marketing department. It’s currently four people—three board members and one volunteer—who meet once a month on zoom, talk about issues facing MA home educators, divvying up responsibilities, and figuring out how we can best serve you.</p>

<p>We share a commitment to helping people explore and strengthen their understanding of homeschool regulation, approach, and benefit. Sometimes we’re not certain of our reach or impact, but we keep showing up with the faith that the initiatives we work on are helpful in some way, that being a go-to resource for more than twenty years is what continues to allow homeschoolers to trust in themselves and each other, in the short term and over the long haul.</p>

<p>If you can recall a time when AHEM did this for you, or if it has in the past and still does, Would you consider a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donation</a> to us? We exist for you and because of you, and a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donation</a> - however small - enables us to keep going. It would show us that you believe in us as much as we believe in you. Which, in the end, is what trust and community actually look like.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">Donate securely online</a> or mail a check to AHEM, 40 Herrick Rd, Boxford, MA 01921. AHEM is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and your gift to AHEM is tax-deductible to the extent allowable by law (and greatly appreciated).</p>
