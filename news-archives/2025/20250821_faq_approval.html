		   <h1>FAQ: Approval</h1>
<p>This time of year we get a lot of questions that have to do with approval—Do I need it? What if my town doesn't send a letter? Can I start homeschooling before I have approval?—so we thought we'd try to tackle them all at once. As always, if you have further questions or need help working through particulars, <a href="../../one-on-one.html">AHEM is here to help</a>.</p>

<h4>Do I need &ldquo;approval&rdquo; to homeschool in Massachusetts?</h4> 
<p>You may have heard it said that when you send your education plan you are not asking for “approval” but rather informing your town of your plan. On one hand, the law recognizes the parents› right to homeschool. On the other, the <em><a href="../../charles.html">Charles</a></em> decision does use the word “approval.” Most accurately, we might say that you are not being approved but that your education plan is. For a fuller explanation see <a href="../2022/20220224_fact_1.html">this post from our Homeschool Fact Check series</a>.</p> 

<h4>Can my town reject my education plan?</h4>
<p>No. A district cannot simply deny or reject an education plan. The law outlines a process to be followed if immediate approval is not given. The district must let you know why they are not approving your plan and give you an opportunity to respond and to work with them on resolving any issues. See “General Considerations” on our <a href="../../tips.html">Tips page</a>.</p> 

<h4>I haven't gotten an approval letter from my town; what should I do?</h4>
<p>While some towns do send approval letters, others do not. There is nothing in the law that requires districts to send such letters. You do not need a letter in order to homeschool. However, many homeschoolers feel more confident with a letter in hand. If your town does not send one, you can request one. See <a href="../../approval_letters.html">this article on approval letters</a> for more.</p>

<h4>So can I just start homeschooling?</h4> 
<p>The answer to this one is a bit complicated. The General Laws of the state speak of the need for prior approval. However, Charles makes clear that once an education plan has been submitted, the burden shifts to the district. While no child has ever been ordered back to school during the approval process, the decision on whether to begin before approval is secured may depend on individual circumstances and comfort levels.  For more on this issue, see <a href="../2023/20231109_fact_8.html">Fact Check: Prior Approval</a> and <a href="../../unsnarling_charles.html">Unsnarling Charles</a>.</p> 

<h4>I was approved but my town is asking me to send back a signed form. What should I do?</h4> 
<p>Approval is approval. If you have a statement that your education plan was approved for the year, you shouldn't need to worry about additional requests.</p>

<h4>I said in my education plan that I would submit a progress report at the end of the year but in the approval letter they mention work samples as well. Should I respond?</h4> 
<p>The law is clear that the method of evaluation should be agreed upon by the district and the parents. Your specific response may depend on your history with your district. Some parents will choose to respond and reiterate their stated method. Others will just ignore the request. Again, approval is approval. There is no category for conditional approval. See <a href="../../progress_reports.html">AHEM's article on progress reports</a>.</p>
