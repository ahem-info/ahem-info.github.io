<h1>Protecting Independent Homeschooling: A New Webpage from AHEM</h1>
		<p>Since 2003, <a href="../../about.html">our mission</a> at AHEM has been to  advocate for independent homeschooling across the Commonwealth. We are  happy to say that, while we are by no means the least regulated state,  homeschool reporting remains relatively easy for most and there have been no  significant changes in the law for quite some time. We are aware, however, that  there are always changes in the homeschool landscape and that this may cause  concern for some. With that in mind, we have revamped our website to include a page specifically  devoted to homeschool advocacy and our mission to preserve the freedom we  currently enjoy. On the page “<a href="../../best-advocate.html">Protecting Independent Homeschooling</a>,” you can find articles about  homeschool advocacy, issues of concern, and stories of homeschoolers who have  advocated for their rights. In the coming months, we will be adding to this  page, discussing questions like: “What is ‘independent homeschooling’?” and “What  about homeschool funding?”</p>
		  <p>Parents across the  country gained the freedom to educate their own children when they advocated  for themselves (you can read the history of homeschooling in Massachusetts <a href="../../history.html">here</a>. It is our belief that continued  advocacy by homeschooling parents is not only vital to maintaining this  freedom but also that it is doable. Our mission is to give you the tools you  need to advocate for yourself.</p>
  <h3>What can you do to  help preserve homeschooling freedom?</h3>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>Educate yourself on the homeschooling laws. All homeschoolers should <a href="../2023/20230309_reading_law.html">read and familiarize themselves with the laws that govern homeschooling</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5QWK836" target="_blank">Take our latest survey</a>. Surveys are a big part of what we do. They are how we check the pulse of towns across the state. While homeschooling policy has not changed, surveys help us keep an eye on the practice of homeschool reporting so we can be alert to new trends. (And be sure to check back! We typically have three big surveys each year.)</li>
          <li><a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v" target="_blank">Sign up for AHEM’s email newsletter</a> for updates and tips, including <a href="../2024/20240815_leg_update.html">legislative updates</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="../../vol_app.html">Volunteer</a>. You can become a <a href="../../tpp.html">Town Point Person</a>*, write a <a href="https://www.ahem.info/meet_ma_hsers.html">Meet MA Homeschoolers</a> piece, help monitor legislation, or <a href="https://www.ahem.info/news.html#foreign">help with translation projects</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="../../support.html">Support AHEM</a> so we can continue to carry out our mission. AHEM is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. We are completely volunteer-run, but we do need your support to continue.</li>
          <li>Help us get the word out! Share information about AHEM with other homeschoolers and direct them to <a href="../../index.html">our website</a> when they have questions. You can also tell your <a href="../../libraries.html">local librarian</a> about us (they are some of our best contacts) or ask them to sponsor a <a href="https://www.ahem.info/libraries#presentations">homeschooling presentation</a> by AHEM.</li>
        </ul>
