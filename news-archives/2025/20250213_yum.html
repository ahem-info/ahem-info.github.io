<h1>Yum: A Bite-Sized and Nourishing Homeschooling Strategy for All Ages</h1>
		   <h4>by Sophia Sayigh</h4>
		   <p><em>The following is a slightly edited version of an article which we first offered in 2020. Though the world is no longer on lock-down, a cold and dreary February can make any homeschool family a little stir-crazy. We hope that this will inspire anyone who needs to change things up a little this time of year. </em></p>
       <img src="../../images/daydreaming.JPG" alt=""/>
	   <p>Are you struggling with the kids home full-time? Maybe you feel a little trapped a claustrophobic as sleety winter storms seem to roll in day after day. For anyone needing a change and a chance to recharge, I  offer this strategy to reset life at home.</p>
	     <p>Take what you like,  and leave the rest. There is not one right way to homeschool. In fact, that is  one of homeschooling&rsquo;s strengths—flexibility to meet the varied needs of  individual members of a family. If what you&rsquo;re doing is working for you, stop  reading and carry on!</p>
	     <p>A couple of things to  acknowledge that make school different from learning at home:</p> 
       <ul class="nested">
         <li>A lot of the day at a brick-and-mortar school is filled with classroom       management, not something a parent at home with their own kids needs to       spend time on. So let&rsquo;s slash the typical six hour day to 90       minutes. Next, let&rsquo;s assume those 90 minutes of &ldquo;structured learning&rdquo;* can       happen anytime, day or night, weekday or weekend, and that on one day you       can spend more than 90 minutes, and on another day you might spend none of       the 90 allocated minutes. You can do all 90 minutes in one sitting so to       speak, or split them up over the course of several days.</li>
         <li>Schools       divide learning into subjects because they need to       standardize curriculum and track the progress of a classroom of students.       But life is not divided up into subjects—everything is interconnected—so       most activities encompass a range of subjects. For example, cooking can       include reading a recipe, measuring ingredients, science of heat, cultural       history of a recipe, not to mention art, hands-on skills, and so on.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The 90 minute strategy  includes:</p>
       <ul class="nested">
         <li>Thirty       minutes of reading aloud from picture books or chapter books or classic       literature or nonfiction books or anything really (cookbooks,       instructions, newspaper articles). Student&rsquo;s choice. During this time kids       can sit on a lap and listen, or draw, act out the story, do stretches or       somersaults on the floor, practice fingering on a guitar, whatever floats       their boat. Feel free to stop and discuss as you go, or answer questions       when they come up. It is fine to reread a book many times or to try something       new. Oh, and graphic novels and listening to audiobooks count as reading.</li>
         <li>Thirty       minutes of playing a game. A board or card game can be completed in one       sitting, or you can leave it set up and return to it for days or even       weeks. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, anyone? Many parlor games don’t require any equipment at all. Or maybe outside yard time, a sidewalk game, or a brisk walk is called for to blow off some steam.</li>
         <li>Thirty       minutes of making something, or learning a new skill. Maybe this will be       cooking or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020063-made-in-the-pan-chocolate-cake?action=click&module=Local%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=5" target="_blank">baking</a>. Maybe it will be learning to sew. Maybe it will be building. Maybe it will be playing music or singing together. Maybe it will be doing the laundry or starting seeds for the garden. Share an interest or skill you have, or ask your       child to teach you something.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The 90 minutes is  meant to be spent all together, not per child. Aim to interest the oldest  child, and rest assured the younger ones will be fine coming along for the  ride. And if someone doesn&rsquo;t want to take part, don&rsquo;t push it. No power  struggles.</p>
         <p>If you find that in  the course of reading or cooking or sewing, your child catches a bug and wants  to read all of a series, or invent their own recipes, or learn about the  science of cooking, or contribute to (or start!) a community drive to donate to the local food pantry, or in any way dig more deeply into a subject, let them run  with it! And if they tire of it, just go back to your 90 minutes and see what  arises next.</p>
         <p>Leave available at all  times whatever supplies you have on hand for art, music, and reading lying  about. Audiobooks are great accompaniments to crafting or building, as are  podcasts. Of course have available games, puzzles, dress up, and toys as well,  and let free play rule! Conversation that happens between family members over  the course of a day counts for a lot. And another pastime, daydreaming, is  underrated.</p>
         <p>Try to be flexible,  and if you realize anyone is stressed, stop and breathe. If the strategy is not  working, change the strategy, as many times as you need to. If at the end of a  week you haven&rsquo;t amassed the equivalent of 90 minutes a day of these activities,  wipe the slate clean and start over. And take note—if it works to read for all  90 minutes and not play games or make things, go with that flow. If you can  only manage 30 or 60 minutes, that&rsquo;s fine. Be kind to yourself. This framework  is meant to help make your homeschooling easier and less stressful, not more.</p>
         <p>Some of the millions  of possible ways this could play out:</p>
       <ul class="nested">
         <li>Family       A wakes up, completes 90 minute schedule, rest of the day is spent as each       wishes.</li>
         <li>Family       B members wake up at different times, eat breakfast randomly, pursue       varying interests or obligations over the course of the day, make dinner       together, play a game after dinner, and then read aloud before bed.</li>
         <li>Family       C wakes up, makes and eats breakfast together, disperses to work or play,       reconvenes to eat lunch and play a game, disperses to work and play, reads       aloud before bed.</li>
         <li>Family       D members wake up at different times, eat breakfast randomly, everyone       gets busy and never convenes to read or make anything, or play a game.       Don&rsquo;t worry about it and see what tomorrow brings. It is fully possible       that Family D&rsquo;s kids are doing just fine without the planned 90 minutes,       but having a soft spot for reading aloud, I hope they fit that in       somewhere.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>At the end of a day or  week, if you have the energy for it, jot down some of what you&rsquo;ve observed your  kids engaging in. How are they spending their time? What are their interests?  What habits have they developed? It will be fun and eye opening to look back on  these notes.<br>
         <p>I am guessing that  your children, if they have forgotten, will rediscover their innate ability to  learn voraciously, and you might too! Embrace this change as it happens. When  you return to your normal routine, I won&rsquo;t be surprised if you find that your time  will be more productive and less stressful.</p>
         <p>* How is structured  learning defined for public school? From the <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr27.html?section=all" target="_blank">Massachusetts DESE</a>: Structured  learning time shall mean time during which students are engaged in regularly  scheduled instruction, learning activities, or learning assessments within the  curriculum for study of the 'core subjects' and 'other subjects.' In  addition to classroom time where both teachers and students are present,  structured learning time may include directed study, independent study,  technology-assisted learning, presentations by persons other than teachers,  school-to-work programs, and statewide student performance assessments.</p>
  <p><em>Translation:</em> pretty much  everything constitutes structured learning time. If your child  is engaged in an activity and is learning from it, it counts. And I challenge  you to find an activity that a child doesn&rsquo;t learn from.</p>
