<h1>AHEM’s Mission: Legislative</h1>
<p>So you get <a href="http://eepurl.com/oXg3v" target="_blank">AHEM newsletters</a>, you’ve used the AHEM site to answer some critical questions, or you’ve heard other homeschoolers talk about AHEM at a park day. But what do you really know about who and what AHEM is? We’d love for you to learn more!</p> 

<p>AHEM began as a collective effort of a few homeschooling parents dedicated to protecting and advancing educational choice for their families. Over the next twenty years it has become a critical support to home educators across Massachusetts! Over the next few weeks, we will highlight some of the work that AHEM does in support of the important work that you each do in your home with your children. Our hope is that you will understand the role you can play in keeping AHEM alive.</p>

<p>AHEM’s mission is to gather and disseminate information about homeschooling in Massachusetts through education, advocacy, and events. One critical thing we do is to keep an eye on legislation working its way through the legislature that could affect homeschoolers across the Commonwealth. This year we have been carefully tracking bills that:</p>
		   <ul class="nested">
<li>Propose changes to the minimum and maximum compulsory school attendance ages (MA H524, MA S437)</li>
<li>Would alter current practices by introducing a new oversight framework that would shift how homeschoolers are monitored and evaluated potentially altering long-standing practices and requirements (MA H518)</li> 
<li>Specifically mention homeschool and home educated students (MA S437, MA H712)</li>
</ul>
<p>By monitoring and analyzing these bills, we are able to keep the community informed and advocate for the preservation of independent homeschooling.</p> 

<p>This work requires time, dedication, and resources. With your support we can continue to afford the software that tracks legislation, share timely updates with families, and send letters to legislators to strengthen our presence and advocate for what is in the best interest of the community.</p>

<p>This research and advocacy is <strong><em>critical,</em></strong> but not something that many of us have time, energy, or resources to do. And it comes at a cost: while AHEM board members and volunteers put in the people hours to watch and review legislation at no cost, LegiNation costs $500 a year. In order to continue this service, this is  money AHEM needs to raise each year to cover costs.</p>

<p>Is this work important to you? We’d love for you to be involved. Consider <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donating</a> today. It takes a village to make this work. You might think $25 is too little, but it’s not! Please consider a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">donation</a> in any amount. We will keep doing the work as long as we can pay the bills! <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=TU4P3CEU6JHBJ&amp;source=url" target="_blank">Donate securely online</a> or mail a check to AHEM, 40 Herrick Rd, Boxford, MA 01921. AHEM is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and your gift is tax-deductible to the extent allowable by law (and greatly appreciated).</p>
