				<h1>AHEM's Sample Education Plan, Annotated</h1>
				<p>The first step to start officially homeschooling in Massachusetts is to submit an education plan to your local school superintendent. We suggest submitting your education plan a couple of weeks before school starts if you can, but you can remove a child from school at any time during the year.</p> 

<p>AHEM offers a sample education plan. This plan represents the minimum that has been accepted as written by some school districts in Massachusetts. It is meant to be used as a template. Please edit it to reflect what you plan to do in your homeschool.  For example: delete or add subjects, indicate specific materials you plan to use, specify your form of evaluation, etc.</p> 

<p>Below we present our Sample Education Plan in a slightly new format. This template includes all the information from the <a href="../../sample_ed_plan.html">Sample Ed Plan</a> you may know and love but with some added notes and links to help you find more information, should your town ask for additional information. As always, if you have questions about the requests your town is making, you can reach out to AHEM at any time for <a href="../../one-on-one.html">one-on-one support</a>.</p>

				<p>This education plan is submitted in accordance with the <em>Charles</em> decision:</p>

					<p>This sample education plan represents the minimum that has been accepted as written by some school districts in Massachusetts. It is meant to be used as a template.</p> 
			<p><strong>Please edit this plan to reflect what you plan to do in your homeschool.  For example: delete or add subjects, indicate specific materials you plan to use, specify your form of evaluation, etc.</strong> </p>
      <p>Please be aware that your town may respond by asking for more information. Sometimes these are legitimate requests and sometimes they will ask for more than the law requires. We recommend that all homeschoolers educate themselves on what is and isn't required in Massachusetts and we have provided lots of resources to help you do so. Please read through  <a href="../../tips.html">Tips for Writing Your Education Plan</a>  or further information on customizing and submitting your own plan according to the <em><a href="../../charles.html">Charles</a></em> and <em><a href="../../brunelle.html">Brunelle</a></em> decisions.</p>
			<h3>Privacy</h3>
		  <p>If you wish to add wording regarding privacy of student records to your education plan, see <a href="../../privacy.html">Privacy and Your Education Plan</a><a href="#"> f</a>or possible wording.</p>
		  <h3>Forms</h3>
			<p>Even though forms are not required, some schools find that forms make their lives easier, and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. Sometimes, forms created by the school district contain extralegal requests. To deal with this, homeschoolers can simply cross out the extralegal requests, or just submit an education plan instead of the form.</p>
			<p>In the past, AHEM has offered a form for our subscribers’ use, which is basically the AHEM sample education plan you see here in a different format. The demand for our form has become so great, that we decided to release it to the world.</p>
