<h1>Online Forms</h1>

<p>While forms or applications are not mentioned as part of the home education laws in Massachusetts, some districts find that forms make their lives easier and ask homeschoolers to use them. In a recent survey, two-thirds of respondents reported that their town does ask for some sort of form. Forms or applications are an administrative aid for the school system. For homeschoolers to use them is a courtesy. How one handles a form, online or otherwise, is an individual choice depending on the nature of the form itself and the prior relationship between the individual and the district. 		   </p> 

<p>Some homeschoolers simply decline to fill out district forms. It is always fine to just submit your education plan. You may have some back and forth with the school about it, but our surveys indicate that many have success in simply sending in their education plan. Though two-thirds are asked for a form, just over half (56%) are approved when they submit just an education plan.</p>

<p>Of those who do choose to use their district’s form, many opt to provide their basic identifying information but then to cross out any items that are not required and/or to write “see attached” on the form and to attach their education plan to it (see <a href="../2021/20210716_forms.html">this article on form</a>s and <a href="../2022/20220324_fact_3.html">this one</a>). Our numbers indicate that half of those asked for a form submit it along with their education plan (one third of the total number of respondents).</p>

<p>Online forms present some additional obstacles. Our recent survey shows some towns are using them but the numbers are still very small (eight percent are asked for an online form, but some of these still have the option of a paper form). Online forms in general are concerning because they don't have the flexibility of paper forms to just write &ldquo;see attached&rdquo; or to skip or cross out sections.</p> 

<p>Some of the same principles as for paper forms may apply however. Homeschoolers have options in how to deal with online forms depending on the nature of the forms and their individual comfort levels:</p>
	<ul class="nested">
<li>As always, one may choose to ignore the online form altogether and mail (email or snail mail) their education plan.</li> 
<li>One may mail their education plan but also put basic info on the online form. Where there are blanks on an online form requiring more information, one may refer to the mailed documents with a statement along the lines of: &ldquo;see ed plan emailed/mailed on DATE.&rdquo; If the online form provides that option, the education plan may also be uploaded.</li> 
</ul>
<p>If there are questions about the information a form asks for, our <a href="20250801_ed_plan_annotated.html">annotated education plan</a> provides some helpful links. And, of course, you can always contact AHEM’s <a href="../../one-on-one.html">one-on-one support</a> program.</p>
