<h1>AHEM’s Mission: Education</h1>

<p>AHEM is the most quoted resource on how to homeschool in Massachusetts. We have years of experience and articles on issues ranging from <a href="../../getting_started.html">how to get started</a> and ideas on <a href="../../networking.html">connecting with other homeschoolers</a> to <a href="../2023/20230713_panic.html">what to do if you are facing push back</a> from your local school. We are in the process of revamping our website to make all of this information even more accessible.</p> 

<p>This trove of information is indispensable to all of us. Can’t quite remember what case law says about a specific topic? AHEM has <a href="../../ma_hs_law.html">many articles</a> breaking it down. Want to find other homeschoolers in your area? AHEM has <a href="../../tpp.html">local contacts</a> for you. Wondering what other approaches families take in home education? AHEM has many examples of <a href="../../meet_ma_hsers.html">what other MA families are doing</a>.</p> 

<p>However, maintaining this is not free. We have costs associated with website upkeep each year. We need the support of you, our local homeschooling community, to keep these resources available for those of us homeschooling now and those who might choose this wonderful path in the coming years. Would you consider <a href="../../support.html">donating</a> today? Any amount is helpful. Set up a recurring donation and keep donating for years to come! <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=MBK78HUEEBXRW&source=url&ssrt=1757595667799" target="_blank">Donate securely online</a> or mail a check to AHEM, 40 Herrick Rd, Boxford, MA 01921. AHEM is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and your gift to AHEM is tax-deductible to the extent allowable by law (and greatly appreciated).</p>
