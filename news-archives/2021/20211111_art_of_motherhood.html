                                 <h1>The Art of Motherhood: Taking Care of Ourselves (To Remind Myself)</h1>
                               <h4>By Erin            Matica</h4>
                                 <p>When            we are pregnant and while our children are very young, our focus and            energy seem to be only about them. That is how it should be. All            mammal species, most birds, and even some reptiles, fish, and insects            take exquisite care of their young. The robins nesting in our barn            eaves seem to have boundless energy brooding, feeding, protecting,            nest cleaning, etc. The chicks grow fast and fledge within weeks, but            during that nestling stage the parents are working non-stop. Many            will continue to feed and look after their young even after they've            fledged.</p>
                                   <p>Those            of us who have been fortunate enough to breastfeed our children know            how those mothering hormones help facilitate bonding and the care of            our little ones. It is all very intense and very magical. Homeschooling            adds another layer of intensity. As our children get older, it is            healthy (and very important!) that they can separate from us when            they are ready. Too often today I see parents who are holding their            kids back. I know the world can be a scary place, but it is also            infinitely interesting and full of wonder. Our job as parents is to            teach our kids to be safe in the world and give them the skills to            competently enter into adulthood. After all, we are not going to be            around forever.</p>
                                   <p>As            our kids grow and change, they are going to have more of their own            opinions about the world and their lives. We would do well to listen            to them. Our roles are to be supportive—not controlling. Only say            <q>no</q> if you really need to. Allowing kids to make decisions (and            mistakes) is how a person learns to trust herself. If you want kids            to grow up strong, competent, secure in themselves, morally sound,            and comfortable in their own skins—we have to let them go, even if we            are not ready. They will tell us when they are ready, and they will            thank us for our trust and support. After all, it is not our life!</p>
                                   <p>Getting            back to the title of this essay, in the natural way of children            growing and changing so too do we change and grow. Now that my five            kids are in their teens and twenties, some don't live at home any            more. All but my youngest (age 16) are licensed drivers. A new time            in my life seems to be opening up. It is like a weaning. I'm finding            that long-put-off projects are coming to the forefront and new plans            are being made, too. What I'm trying to say is that just            because we are moms, and homeschooling moms at that, does not mean            that we should forget about ourselves.</p>
                                   <p>Taking            the time to do the things that are just for you, the things that            bring you joy, should not always be left on the back burner. It can            be very difficult to balance partner, kids, cooking and housework,            paid work, and other responsibilities, but we have to hold onto            ourselves. Here's why: First of all, you are teaching the kids that            you are not some martyr sacrificing herself (this can end up a very            unhealthy codependent family relationship). Kids learn that you are a            real person with real passions. They watch us taking care of            ourselves and learn to do the same. That kind of self-respect is            enormously important in the world.</p>
                                   <p>Secondly,            doing what we love, those things that are just for us, makes us            happy. Being happy is no small thing, and it makes us a better person            and a better mom. Balance is everything. Like Thoreau said,            <q>Simplify! Simplify! Simplify!</q> Prioritize your            life so you are not wasting precious time, money, and energy on            things that don't really matter. That way, you are spending time,            money, and energy on the things that really do matter to you and that            bring you joy.</p>
                                   <p>Thirdly,            and most importantly of all, we need to take care of our health. If            you have lost interest in your passions, or you are just too tired,            look into your health. I had just come off a couple of years of what            seemed to be nothing but death and disaster. These events I had no            control over, nor did I have control over the inevitable extended            family upheaval. The constant stress really destroyed my health and            I've spent the last four years (very slowly) recovering.</p>
                                   <p>Luckily,            after many trials and tribulations, I've found a health care practitioner            who has brought me back from the dead (not literally, but it feels            like it). All of this deferred maintenance is finally getting the            attention it deserves. Take care of yourself! Don't let the stress of            uncontrollable episodes in your life put you over the edge. Listen to            your body. Sometimes we've had symptoms for so long we normalize            them—fatigue, joint pain, trouble sleeping, PMS, etc. Any symptoms            that don't make you feel energized and happy every day need to be            looked into. You will be a better person and a better mom if you take            care of yourself. You are worth it!</p>
