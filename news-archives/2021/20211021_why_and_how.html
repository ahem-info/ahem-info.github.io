              <h4>by Sophia          Sayigh</h4>
                              <p><em><q>It is one of the most beautiful          compensations of this life that no man can sincerely try to help          another without helping himself…</q> - Ralph Waldo Emerson</em> </q>

	                            <p>In          this day and age, homeschoolers represent a market. There are many          businesses catering to homeschoolers&rsquo; needs—or perceived needs. When          first starting out it can be especially tempting to sign up for a          multitude of classes or experiences rather than putting your energy          into a grassroots network such as a local homeschool support group.          Before you know it, your days are filled with activity and you don&rsquo;t          look back.</p>
	                            <p>The          intangibles you&rsquo;d be missing out on—real connection with other          homeschoolers and personal empowerment—might be some of the best kept          secrets of homeschooling, as well as what would sustain you on this          path in the end. It&rsquo;s worth putting some time and effort in, and yes,          if shy, getting your courage up, to figure out how to insinuate          yourself into a group of homeschoolers, rather than filling your day          with activities that leave you with a busy day void of meaningful          relationships.</p>
	                            
	                            <h4>Steps to take in building connection with other homeschoolers:</h4>
	                            <ul class="nested">
	                              <li>Acts create connection: give               of yourself.</li>
	                              <li>Make spending time with other               adults a priority; schedule it in.</li>
	                              <li>Be patient. Connections are               built one relationship at a time.</li>
              </ul>
	                            <h4>How          support groups work</h4>
	                              <p>Support groups range in their level of organization, from loose groups          of people who get together from time to time, to highly organized          groups with missions and boards. Some are inclusive and welcome          everyone; others cater to a certain educational philosophy or religion.
								   It is fine to try out a few and see where you feel comfortable, or to          start your own.</p>
	                              <p>Homeschooling          support groups can act as frameworks for networking, communication and          support. It is important to realize that subscribing to an email list          or joining a Facebook group does not magically make you part of some          deeper pre-existing community. Ready-made communities don&rsquo;t exist; they          are an illusion. You must put time and effort in to forge friendships.          You get from the experience what you put into it.</p>
	                              <p>Group          activities, such as field trips, get-togethers, or classes, often          depend on the unique energies and interests individuals bring to the          group. Events and activities can be planned by individuals, or in          collaboration with others. It is empowering to realize that you,          children included, can create the opportunities and experiences you          want for yourselves.</p>
	                              <p>When          attending a meeting or event, be sure to introduce yourself as a          homeschooler. A good way to meet people is to extend yourself: organize          a field trip or other event, host a meet up, either virtual or          in-person.</p>
	                              <h4>Examples          of rituals and social events you can organize:</h4>
	                            <ul class="nested">
	                              <li>Not-Back-to-School Picnic</li>
	                              <li>Valentine Exchange</li>
	                              <li>Presentation Night</li>
	                              <li>Camping trips</li>
	                              <li>History and science fairs</li>
	                              <li>Parent support meetings</li>
	                              <li>Weekly field games</li>
	                              <li>Meeting at ponds, parks,               playground hopping</li>
	                              <li>Book, game and puzzle swaps</li>
	                              <li>Talent shows</li>
	                              <li>Field trips</li>
              </ul>
	                            <h4>Swapping          expertise</h4>
	                              <p>Another level of interaction is the swapping of expertise and interest          between homeschooling parents and others&rsquo; children. People have been          known to organize homeschooler-led groups in literature, writing,          including historical fiction and child-published newspapers, history,          classic films, math, including logic and set theory, Math Counts,          Destination Imagination, art, knitting/sewing clubs, pet clubs,          singing, storytelling, theatre groups, and more. Some people charge a          nominal fee for leading a class. Others feel that as they give, so will          they receive, and gladly put their energies into the <q>pot.</q> In addition          to the obvious <q>educational</q> benefits of all these interactions, whole          families get to know one another, lives intersect, and interdependence          develops.</p>
