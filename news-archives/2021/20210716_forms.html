         <h1>Conform to Forms?</h1>
           <p>Although  it is not required to fill out a school-generated form to homeschool in  Massachusetts, some school officials find that forms make their lives easier,  and so they ask homeschoolers to use them. </p>
         <p>Some  homeschoolers have a philosophical objection to filling out a form from the  school. It is always fine to just submit your education plan instead of filling  out the form. You may have some back and forth with the school about it. </p>
         <h3>Adapting the school&rsquo;s form</h3>
         <p>For  many homeschoolers, the form is not inherently repugnant, but is confusing  since forms are never mentioned in Massachusetts law. Sometimes a school will send a form to fill out  even after you have submitted your education plan. To deal with this, homeschoolers who are  willing to submit their plan via form can simply cross out any items that are  not required. Examples include: </p>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>Grade level—grades are a school  necessity, and do not need to exist for homeschoolers if that is not how you go  about homeschooling. For instance, your child may be ahead of &ldquo;grade level&rdquo; in  one area, behind in another, and on target in another. This is perfectly fine.  What matters is progress. And homeschooling does not need to match the public  school curriculum but must equal the local public school's&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href="https://www.ahem.info/charles.html">in thoroughness and efficiency</a>.&rdquo; </li>
           <li>Telephone number—some parents prefer to  keep school correspondence in writing, so choose not to provide a phone number. </li>
           <li>Email address—email is a communication  option that works for some, and not others. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>You  can also edit anything the school asks for that does not match up with your  education plan, for instance, <a href="https://www.ahem.info/methods_eval.html">method  of evaluation</a>. School forms often do not have  a box to check off for &ldquo;progress report,&rdquo; or their boxes include more than one  form of evaluation as a single choice. If you do not see the method of  evaluation that you plan to use as a single choice, write it in. </p>
         <p>Forms  may ask for &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo; and &ldquo;textbooks&rdquo; that lead homeschoolers to believe  they have to use school materials or a boxed curriculum while in fact &ldquo;teaching  materials&rdquo; run the gamut. The <em>Brunelle</em> court pointed out  that …some of the most effective curricular materials…may not be tangible.  For example, travel, community service, visits to educationally enriching  facilities and places, and meeting with various resource people, can provide  important learning experiences apart from the four corners of a text or  workbook.(<a href="https://www.ahem.info/brunelle.html"><em>Brunelle</em> at  518</a>) </p>
         <h3>Extralegal requests</h3>
         <p>Further,  sometimes forms created by the school district contain extralegal requests. In  addition to parental qualifications, subjects, hours, materials, and form of  evaluation, forms (or policies) ask to attach one or more of the following: </p>
         <ul class="nested">
           <li>Proof of residency and/or address </li>
           <li>Proof of occupancy </li>
           <li>Proof of parent&rsquo;s identity </li>
           <li>Original or copy of student&rsquo;s birth&nbsp;certificate  or passport </li>
           <li>Proof of vaccination </li>
         </ul>
         <p>According  to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AHEMsurvey">AHEM’s data</a>, most schools do not ask for these. Interestingly, these are  things schools require from families who are enrolling their children in the  public school. According to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary  Education’s instructions to schools:</p>
         <blockquote><p><q><em>May a school district include home  school [sic] students in the student enrollment count that the district reports  to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for statistical and state  funding purposes?</em></q></p>
           <p><q>Home school [sic] students are not  considered to be enrolled in a school district. Thus they cannot be counted as  part of the school&rsquo;s membership, for state reporting purposes, even if the  school district allows them to participate in some extra-curricular or other  school activities.</q></p></blockquote>
           <p>Homeschoolers are not to be registered or enrolled in the public  school system, even if they are receiving special education services, and the  school should not have a need for any documentation beyond a parent-generated  education plan. </p>
  <h3>Meeting in the middle</h3>
           <p>If your school district has sent  you a form, the path of least resistance is probably to fill out name&nbsp;and  address of parent or guardian and student on the form, and then scrawl  &quot;See attached&quot; on the rest of it and staple your education plan to the  form. That way you are submitting your plan in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ahem.info/charles.html"><em>Charles</em></a> decision, with a nod to accommodating their administrative  organizing tool. </p>
           <p>Remember  that both the AHEM <a href="https://www.ahem.info/sample_ed_plan.html">sample education plan</a> and the <a href="https://www.ahem.info/progress_reports.html">sample  progress report</a> are modeled on the minimum that have been approved as an education plan and  accepted as a progress report in Massachusetts. It is not unreasonable for  school officials to ask for some more detail for either one. Familiarize  yourself with this grey area by reading <a href="https://www.ahem.info/tips.html"><em>Tips  for Writing Your Education Plan.</em></a> Negotiating and working with school officials  usually ends in getting approval for homeschooling. </p>

Readers still need to make their own decision on how best to proceed.</sub> </p>
