         <h1>To Meet or Not to Meet?</h1>
		   <p>Many          homeschoolers in Massachusetts are currently in the process of          submitting the method of evaluation outlined in their approved          education plans. According to <a href="../2019/20190711_policy_and_practice_analysis.html">AHEM’s          database</a>, for most that will          be a <a href="../../methods_eval.html">progress          report</a>, but others may use <a href="../../methods_eval.html">test          results or dated work samples</a>.          In this unusual homeschooling year, we’ve learned that some districts          are asking to meet with homeschooling parents, and in some cases          children, in order to perform their oversight function.</p>
                           <p>
                           <strong>Are meetings required?</strong> This question has been floating around in          Massachusetts for decades. As with many such questions in our state,          there isn’t a definitive yes or no answer, because the Massachusetts          courts have not taken up the question, as they have for <a href="../../brunelle.html">home          visits</a>, for example.</p>
<p>
                           Still, a look at the relevant <a href="../../ma_hs_law.html">statutes          and case law</a>, as well as common          practice, points to the answer being “no.” In the unlikely event that          this issue reached the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, many          issues would be looked at, including whether meetings were <q><a href="../../hs_guidelines.html">essential</a></q> </a> to ensuring the state interest in the          education of its children.</p>
                           <p>
                           Thus, homeschoolers can politely say that they prefer to keep          communications in writing, and submit the form of evaluation they          included in their approved education plan.</p>
                           <p>
                           <strong>What if a family in these circumstances chooses to meet with their          school officials?</strong> Another question that often arises in this          discussion involves whether or not all homeschoolers in the state would          be negatively affected by some families acquiescing to meetings, or          agreeing to comply with other gray area requests that likely don&rsquo;t meet          the standard of <q>essential.</q></p>
                           <p>
                           If a case did reach a higher court, the court would likely look at          common practice in the process of making their decision. However, that          examination would be only one part of a much broader study of the          question at hand in relation to established statutes and          constitutionality. And of course, this process would take years.</p>
                           <p>
                           The possible ripple effects of overreporting, however, can be more          immediate and direct. A superintendent who successfully pulls some          parents and/or children into meetings may feel emboldened to push for          more meetings or materials, and/or pressure all families in the          district to follow suit. We also know that school districts in          Massachusetts make extralegal requests of homeschoolers on a regular          basis, and they share information. So, even if the law doesn&rsquo;t change,          the day-to-day reality for homeschoolers can get more difficult if a          critical mass raises the bar of what school officials expect.</p>
                           <p>
                           There may be some families who find that meeting with school officials          is preferable, and even pleasant or helpful. Such instances may not          have a detrimental effect on existing law. They may or may not cause          officials to make greater demands on other families in the district.</p>
                           <p>
                           Every family must make their own decisions about meeting, while          hopefully keeping in mind the potential broader implications.
