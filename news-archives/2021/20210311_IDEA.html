         <h1>IDEA Equitable Services Stakeholder Meeting</h1>
		   <p>At the request of the Massachusetts Department of Elementary    and Secondary Education (DESE), AHEM attended an IDEA Equitable Services    Stakeholder meeting on March 10, 2021 to discuss additional Individuals with    Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Equitable Services funding for students    with disabilities who are homeschooled. DESE briefly addressed non-compliance    identified by complainants in a letter submitted to the Office of Special    Education Programs (OSEP) dated October 27, 2017.</p>
               <p>DESE also discussed    the corrective action it has taken to address the issue, including the    allocation of additional funds for Equitable Services to parentally placed    students with disabilities in private schools and those who are homeschooled.    DESE wanted feedback regarding establishing a threshold dollar amount that    would be expended, and what these thresholds should be.</p>
               <p>AHEM attended in order    to be informed about issues that could affect Massachusetts homeschoolers. We    learned that the corrective action has resulted in more Part B funds being    allocated to schools to provide services to private school students and    homeschooled students in 200 districts across Massachusetts.</p>
               <p>Local public schools    are supposed to make sure that children in their districts in need of    services are able to access them. However, homeschoolers are not required to    have their children evaluated, or to accept special needs services from    public schools. DESE plans to keep AHEM informed of developments, and we will    report those to you as we learn of them.</p>
