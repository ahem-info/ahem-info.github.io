	              <h1>In Praise of Park Days</h1>
	      <img src="../../images/park_day.jpg" alt=""/>
<h4>By Roberta Van          Vlack</h4>
	                            <p>Park          days have long been a staple of my family&rsquo;s homeschooling life. With          four kids, these informal, weekly gatherings have provided everyone          (even mom) with an opportunity to make friends and socialize in a way          that no co-op we found ever could. Park days were the one constant in          our schedule from year to year. (My high school age daughter did the          recorded version of Spanish 3 because the live class would have          interfered with park day. One has to have priorities, you know.)</p>
	                            <p>Park          days are a melting pot. Homeschooling in Massachusetts attracts a          pretty diverse group of people, and the families at our local park day          have come from all different backgrounds and perspectives. I have seen          the same scene countless times&mdash;kids of different genders and ages          running around together. And not just running but playing organized          games without any adult input. If you have doubts that homeschoolers          can be properly <q>socialized,</q> this is the place to go to put those          doubts to rest. In my experience, homeschooling kids are incredibly          patient and accepting of others who are different in any way. They are          used to being with kids who don&rsquo;t fit the usual mold.</p>
	                            <p>If          all that doesn&rsquo;t convince you, how about this: park days are for          parents too. You can post online all you want but nothing compares to          getting together with other homeschooling parents for some actual          mid-day adult conversation.</p>
          <p>If          your kids are nervous about their first park day, I would offer one          piece of advice: Be patient. My observation would be that some children,          perhaps especially those who have been in traditional schools, are slow          to connect with others but they usually start to find their place once          they have seen the same kids for a few weeks in a row. If nothing else          works, bringing a new game, craft, or pet along to park day can be a          real ice breaker. Our dog has always been a park day regular but I have          seen birds and lizards and bunnies and guinea pigs come to park days          too. (The dog was a little too interested in the guinea pig but it          ended well.)</p>
          <p>The sidebar has a list of some of the park days that happen in          Massachusetts. If you can’t find one near you, you can check in with          your <a href="../../tpp.html">Town Point Person</a> (and if your town          has no TPP yet, consider <a href="../../vol_app.html">volunteering</a> to be that person). You          can also ask on the <a href="../../forum.html">AHEM forum</a> to find people close by   who          might want to get together, and create your own weekly gathering.</p>
