         <h1>I Sought, I Found, I Joined; Now What?</h1>
                             <h4>by Carol Moxley</h4>
                                                 <h3>You did it!</h3>
		   <p>You made the decision to homeschool, and you found other          homeschoolers to help enrich your homeschooling experience. Great! But,          for some reason, you still feel like you're always on the periphery of          the group. Approaching a cluster of moms at park day is awkward; asking          to be included in a co-op is unthinkable; having a real friend to call          up on the phone is still out of reach. The support you need has to be          there somewhere—others seem to have found it—but how do you go about          forming the network you so desperately need?</p>
                           <h3>Be Friendly</h3>
                           <p>If you're a shy person, it may be asking an awful lot, but once you set          aside your fears and actually step into the circle of your support          group, you'll soon forget why you ever hesitated in the first place.          Begin by introducing yourself to one or two people and mentioning that          you're a new member of the group. There are always helpful souls in the          group willing to draw you in. Look for kids who are roughly the same          ages as your own. Approach their mothers and mention your own kids'          ages. Ask about special activities for the kids, classes within the          community, what approach they use in their homeschooling, whatever—just          break the ice! Reach out to other new homeschoolers. Chances are, they          will be in roughly the same place you are, looking to find their place          within the group.</p>                           
		   <p>Don't          be discouraged if you don't make fast friends with someone immediately.          It's quite possible that the others are just as shy as you are          initially. By showing an interest in others, you will spark their interest          in you.</p>
                           <h3>Be Sensitive</h3>
                           <p>Those who have been members of the group for a while may have already          established a working support network that meets their needs. It's not          that they want to exclude new people, but what they have built for          themselves works so they're not actively seeking to include new people          in their lives the same way you are. Getting to know these people may          be a more gradual process than getting to know other new members who,          like you, are just now seeking out others with whom to connect. One          day, you'll be one of the <q>old</q> members with a solid network          that took you several years to build. When that happens, remember the          new folks just coming in and try to find ways to help them feel          included.</p>
                           <h3>Be Willing</h3>
                           <p>Homeschooling support groups are comprised of people. All the little          (and big!) jobs these people do make each group successful. If you're          new to the group, then Someone Else has been doing all these little          jobs. Someone Else may be tired. Someone Else may need a break. Someone          Else may really appreciate you offering to help.</p>
                           <p>>Sometimes,          what is needed is something as simple as putting stamps and labels on          the newsletters each month or helping with the cleanup committee after          an event. These are ways a new member can be helpful. Sometimes what is          needed is more involved, like actually being the newsletter editor or          serving as an officer for the group. There's no reason why a new          member, bringing new ideas into the group, can't volunteer for these          bigger jobs, too.</p>
                           <p>By          offering to help the group, you not only do your part for the group,          but you also get to know people you might not have otherwise had the          opportunity to meet. Increasing your network within the group serves to          strengthen your family's homeschool support system. It's worth it!</p>
                           <h3>Be Positive</h3>
     <p>No support group is perfect; there's always room for improvement. If          there are things you would like to see changed, rather than complain          about those things, offer to help initiate change. Bring new ideas with          you and offer to help implement those ideas. If there's something the          group could have done to help you feel more included, offer to help set          that up so new members coming in after you will benefit. Constructive          input and an offer of help will go much farther than criticizing the          efforts of others.</p>
                           <h3>Be Proactive</h3>
                           <p>If the group doesn't offer an activity you need, offer to organize it          yourself. A bi-weekly park day for preschoolers, a teen chess club, a          field trip to the local newspaper—whatever you're looking for, chances          are there are others within the group who will appreciate and          participate in what you set up. If attendance isn't what you'd hoped it          to be, don't be discouraged! Many times, people's schedules are already          set and they can't squeeze in the new activity. In time, word will          spread about how much everyone enjoyed the activity and participation          will improve.</p>
                           <h3>Be Appreciative!</h3>
                           <p>Express your appreciation to those who were helpful to you in the          beginning. Not only will this strengthen your relationship with them,          it will encourage them to continue helping others new to the group.          Invite them and their kids for a special coffee and play day at your          house. Include a note of thanks in the group's newsletter, if          appropriate. Even a hug at park day can go a long way to letting          someone know you're glad they were there when you needed a friendly          face.</p>
                           <p>Don't          forget those who are giving of their time to keep the group going. Tell          the newsletter editor how much you look forward to receiving the          newsletter each month. Thank the person who coordinated the field trip          or arranged for the group to get the great discount tickets. Pretty          soon, you'll find yourself on the receiving end of the thanks!</p>
		   <h3>Be Patient</h3>
                           <p>As with all areas of life, making friends among homeschoolers takes          time. Avoid becoming frustrated if the hand of friendship you extend          isn't immediately grasped. By engaging in the group's activities, solid          relationships will form.</p>
                           <p>Finding          out how the group operates can also take time. Learn the procedures for          submitting information to the newsletter. Find out how officers are          chosen. Ask how co-ops and other enrichment groups are formed and          whether new members can participate in mid-year. Attend meetings and          parents' nights out to discover the group's current leaders and what          help is needed.</p>
                           <p>To          paraphrase a familiar expression, <q>You'll only get out of your          support group as much as you put into it.</q> Trying to find your          place in your homeschool group while you're also struggling as a new          homeschooler can be a lot to take on at once. So relax, know that          everything isn't going to fall in place at once, and do what you can          when you can.</p>
                           <p><strong>Remember: It's YOUR support group, too!</strong></p>
