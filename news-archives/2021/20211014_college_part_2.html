                         <h2>Part 2: Applying to College</h2>
                           <h4>By Roberta Van Vlack</h4>
                           <p><a href="20210923_college_part_1.html">Last time I talked about how we homeschool high          school.</a> This information is based on my experiences.          Practices can change rapidly so you should always check with the          College Board and the schools you are applying to for updates. There          are many pieces to the college application process. Today we will look          at: applying for financial aid, creating transcripts, recommendations          and school profiles, the student's part of the application, and          lastly a few words on choosing schools to apply to.</p>
                             <h3>Financial          Aid</h3> 
                             <p>Almost          all schools use the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student          Aid). This is mainly about parents&rsquo; finances and can be          complicated if you have multiple checking/retirement/college          accounts. It is usually available online in October. Some schools          also require the College Board&rsquo;s financial form which isn&rsquo;t much          better; check the College Board site on this. With my oldest, I found          out late that some schools wanted this extra form from me. The deadline          for merit aid for many schools is 11/1 so aim to get all applications          and financial documents in by then.</p>
                             <h3>Transcripts          and Course Summaries</h3> 
                             <p>As          the homeschooling parent, you also get to function as guidance          counselor. There may be slight differences among colleges in terms of          what they ask for but generally you will need to provide: a transcript,          course summaries (optional), a school profile, and a counselor          recommendation letter. Many colleges today use the common application,          or less often the coalition application, which allows you to enter all          this information once and have it sent to participating schools.</p>
                             <p>A          transcript is a one-page document that lists the courses your child has          taken and their grades. There is a fairly standard format for these and          it is best to not be too creative. You want schools to be able to          quickly look at your transcript and understand what it is          communicating. You can format your own. I used a program that did it          for me for about $20/year (only one year is necessary). Such a program          will also calculate the GPA for you. It seemed well worth the cost.</p>
                             <p>A          traditional transcript lists courses by year, eg. all the ninth grade          courses in one section, 10th grade in the next, and so on. Some          homeschoolers choose to group courses by subject — eg. all social          science courses together then all science, all math, etc. Some colleges          are fine with this, but I do know one parent who was asked for a more          traditional transcript when she tried this.</p>
                             <p>The          usual practice for high school is to assign full-year courses one          credit and half year courses a half credit. There are some alternative          ways to figure credits. Colleges themselves tend to use a different          system that considers hours of in-class time. In general, I think it is          always good to use the most common, familiar system. Even more          important, however, is just to be consistent and to explain how you          calculated credits. This can be done in your school profile (see          below).</p>
                             <p>In          general you can assume that one standard, year-long course—eg. algebra          or ninth grade English—is one credit. Other subjects that you have          spent less time on, perhaps Shakespeare or art appreciation, might be a          half credit. Generally you want to aim for 22-26 credits. If you are          unsure of how much a course is worth, you might consider the hours          spent on the material. A one-credit (=full-year) course in the public          schools usually requires somewhere between 120 and 150 hours of work.          But—and this is a big but—homeschooling is more efficient than public          schooling so some homeschoolers will consider 100 hours of work a          one-credit class.</p>
                             <p>As          homeschoolers our courses did not always fit the standard categories.          As noted in <a href="20210923_college_part_1.html">Part 1</a>, I looked back at what we          had done and grouped things together. For instance, we did a little art          appreciation/art history each year. When it came time to make my          children’s transcripts, I looked back at all we had done and made a          determination about whether they did enough to call it a half-credit or          one-credit class. If a course spanned multiple years, I just assigned          it to a year. I tried to make the years fairly even so there would not          be 3 credits in one year and 8 in another.</p>
<p>While          my kids had a few classes that they had done with outside providers and          had grades for, I had never given them grades so I assigned grades          retroactively as I made the transcripts. Basically, I just thought back          over the work they had given me. Had they done all the required work          and done it diligently? That’s an A. If they didn’t quite get          everything done or didn’t do their best work, that’s a B and so on. I          used my school profile to explain my grading strategy.</p>
                             <p>There          is usually a place on the transcript to add notes about particular          classes. If your student did a high school level class before ninth          grade, you can include it as an &ldquo;early earned credit&rdquo; (EEC). I also          marked classes that were done with outside providers and noted which          sciences had lab components. Be sure to indicate which classes are AP          level even if your student didn&rsquo;t take the exam but don&rsquo;t use the AP          label if it was not done with a licensed AP provider (the College Board          strictly regulates the AP label).</p>
                             <p>There          will be places in the application to list activities that your student          has participated in. There may be some things that could be called a          class or an outside activity. For example, my kids have done play          reading with friends. This could be considered a drama class or a          recreational activity/club. You can choose which category these go in          but be sure to only use them once. It can&rsquo;t be both a class and an          activity.</p>
                             <p>The          common app allows you to upload a few transcripts. If you have          transcripts from outside providers, you can use one of these slots for          them (you may want to combine them into one document). If you choose,          you can also use one of these slots to upload course summaries. None of          the colleges my kids applied to specifically asked for them, but I had          heard they might so I created and uploaded them proactively. While this          is more work, it is also an extra way to show what your student has          done and give some idea of how your homeschool works. I created one          document that listed all my children&rsquo;s classes by school year and          included details about the books they read or topics which were          covered.</p>
                             <h3>Recommendation          Letters and School Profile</h3>
                             <p>As          the guidance counselor, you will provide one recommendation for your          student. You will likely need one or two others, one of which must come          from an academic instructor (this is where it is useful to have had at          least one outside class). I acknowledged up front in my counselor          letter that I was the homeschooling parent and just tried to be honest          about my child&rsquo;s particular strengths. This is also a good place to          explain any extenuating circumstances like learning disabilities.</p>
                             <p>Typically          a school profile is a standardized document the guidance counselor          uploads that is the same for all the students in a school. It would          provide demographic information for the area and statistics on how many          of its students take AP classes, etc. As homeschoolers, our school          profiles will look a little different. I found this was a good          opportunity to explain a little bit about our philosophy of education.          I also listed our graduation requirements, educational partners (i.e.          any outside companies we used), and grading system. For the graduation          requirements, I provided a chart showing how many years I had required          in each major subject area (ELA, science, math, etc.). I made this up          retroactively but it is roughly similar to <a href="https://www.mass.edu/foradmin/admissions/documents/DHEAdmissionsStandardsReferenceGuide_2019.pdf" target="_blank">the state’s requirements.</a></p>
                             <p>The          common application includes a small section in the counselor portion          specifically for homeschoolers. I repeated information on philosophy          and grading from my school profile here. They will have places to enter          class rank and the like. I just always checked &ldquo;not applicable&rdquo; or &ldquo;we          do not calculate class rank.&rdquo;</p>
                             <h3>The          Student&rsquo;s Portion of the Application</h3>
                             <p>For          the student&rsquo;s portion, your child will have to provide personal and          demographic information. Though not all schools will require all          parts of the application, most likely your student will also have to          write an essay. There are so many choices for the main essay that          they can really write on anything and make it fit one of the categories          given. Some schools will require extra essays and some          scholarships may require them as well. The common application          essay will go to multiple schools, but if a given school requires an          extra essay, try to gear it to that school specifically. Almost          all schools will require at least one recommendation. For          homeschoolers, some specify that recommendations must come from          academic teachers not related to the student (this is where having had          some outside classes helps). They all ask about activities and awards.          Some schools will require or strongly encourage an interview for          homeschoolers.</p>
                             <p>Testing          is optional at many schools these days. As I discussed in <a href="20210923_college_part_1.html">Part 1</a>, my          kids never did standardized tests until high school but with minimal          prep they did just fine on the SATs. It is probably worth having your          child try the SATs or ACTs. You can always choose not to submit the          scores. Many schools also “super score” which means they look at the          best score for each section. So even if your child did better on          reading/writing at one sitting and math at another, this will not count          against him. Elite colleges (think the Ivies, Duke, etc.) may also want          extra tests. If you are aiming for one of these schools, check their          websites early and plan ahead to get in all the courses and tests          needed. See <a href="20210923_college_part_1.html">Part 1</a> for my schedule for planning          and testing in high school.</p>
                             <h3>Where          Should He Apply? and Will He Get In?</h3>
                             <p>In          general, homeschooler or not, it is good to cast a wide net by applying          to a range of schools, some &ldquo;safety&rdquo; schools, some middle of the road          options, and some reach schools. If your child has done SATs or          ACTs, you can use their scores on those as a rough guide for which          schools are within reach and which might be a stretch. (I have one          child who did not do this—she had her heart set on one fairly          competitive art school and only applied there. Fortunately, for the          sanity of everyone in the house, she got in, but I don&rsquo;t recommend this          strategy for anyone with a heart condition.)</p>
                             <p>My          impression is that most schools these days have gotten used to having          homeschoolers apply. They know how to read a homeschool application.          While you want to communicate as clearly as you can and to try to          present information in ways that they will understand, you don&rsquo;t need          to worry too much about getting everything&nbsp; perfect. Your child          likely has a lot of unique experiences and interests. Just present him          honestly and let those qualities shine through.</p>
