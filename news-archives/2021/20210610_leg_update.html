         <h2>BillS regarding community college tuition</h2>
         <h4><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S1220" target="_blank">S.1220</a></h4>
         <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION by Eric P.  Lesser</p>
         <ul class="nested">
         <li>3/29/2021 Senate Referred to the committee on Labor and  Workforce Development</li>
         <li>3/29/2021 House House concurred</li>
         </ul>
         <p>(1) To be eligible for the scholarship a student shall be  admitted to, and enrolled fulltime in, an eligible postsecondary program within  five years following graduation, not including time spent in the United States  Armed Forces, from an eligible high school in Massachusetts, or completion of  high school as a Massachusetts home school student, or obtaining a GED® or  HiSET® diploma.</p>
       
         <p><em>Summary: This bill would create the Massachusetts  Workforce Opportunity Scholarship. The problem with it is that it introduces  the term <q>home school</q> into law, and would require defining what  qualifies as completion of high school. AHEM’s thought is that it would be less  confusing to simply allow students to be eligible until a certain age, say 23,  not including time spent in the armed forces.</em></p>

         <h4><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H629" target="_blank">H.629</a></h4>
         <p>AN ACT RELATIVE TO NON-PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT ACCESS TO  THE MCAS EXAM by Bradley H. Jones, Jr.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any general or special law to the  contrary, the department of elementary and secondary education shall issue a  report on the feasibility and costs associated with non-public school students  and home schooled students in grade 10 voluntarily taking the Massachusetts  Comprehensive Assessment System exam; provided that said report shall be  provided to the secretary of administration and finance, the commissioner of  elementary and secondary education, and the clerks of the senate and house of  representatives who shall forward the same to the chair of the senate ways and  means committee, the chair of the house ways and means committee, and the house  and senate chairs of the joint committee on education within 6 months of the  effective date of this act.</p>
         
         <p><em>Summary: Would <strong>issue a report</strong> on allowing private and  homeschooled students to take the MCAS. AHEM contacted Rep. Jones and asked  that <q>and home schooled students</q> be removed from the language of the  bill, as homeschoolers are included in the category <q>non-public school  students</q> and introducing the term <q>home schooled</q> into statutory  language begs for it to be defined.</em></p>
         
         <p><em>AHEM&rsquo;s position: Neutral, if "and home schooled students" is removed from the language of the bill.</em></p>
