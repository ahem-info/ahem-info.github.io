		   <h1>A Homeschooling Fable</h1>
		   <p><em>Inspired by the article </em><a href="handling_it.html">Handling It Ourselves</a>,<em> Suzanne  MacDonald was moved to write about her own experience of facing school  officials:</em></p>
		   <p>I consider myself a somewhat seasoned homeschooler as my kids have  never been to school, my oldest being 14. Yet, it took me four years after we  moved to a new town to get the courage up to go to my superintendent's office  to hand deliver my proposals along with my end of the year evaluations and plan  for the following year ( I just give it to them all at once and then I'm done  with it for a year) for the purpose of asking for a letter of approval so  that I can take advantage of the homeschooling discounts at various bookstores.</p>
		   <p>The letter they send does not actually say anything about  accepting my homeschool plan. I receive the same formatted letter each year  stating something like, <q>upon receipt of standardized test scores and  quarterly reports, we are prepared to approve your plan...</q> Each year I  send my reply educating them about the legal homeschooling requirements based  on the <em>Charles</em> decision, and that is the end of it. I never  hear back from them but I don't have proof that I am a homeschooler with an  approved plan, which is what our local Barnes &amp; Noble requires to  get an educator's discount card.</p>
               <p>So last year I went into the superintendent's office, hand  delivered my homeschool materials, asked for a letter of approval, and stated  my reason for wanting it. I went on to inform them that I receive a letter each  year but it doesn't actually say it approves my plan. Not only did the  secretary never even look at my proposal, she did not hesitate and right then  and there rewrote the letter, with a little help from me standing there, that  was still in her computer file and handed it to me. Out the door I went saying  to myself, <q>Whew that wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Another year done!</q> I intend to do the same thing this year.</p>
               <p>I left the office realizing that I think it is a situation where  more often than not they just don't know the legal requirements, and they have  so much on their plates, rather than focus much effort on homeschoolers, they  do what they think they are supposed to do or what they've seen other towns do,  thinking that is law. That's where things become misinterpreted and bogus!</p>
               <p>Moral of the story: Face your fears! It's not as bad or  intimidating as you might think. And very likely you will discover that school  officials only do what they think they are supposed to do most often out of  ignorance.</p>
