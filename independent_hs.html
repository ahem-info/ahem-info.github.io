<h1>Independent Homeschooling</h1>
		   <h2>Defining AHEM’s Mission in a Changing Landscape</h2>
	     <p>AHEM believes that informed and active homeschoolers        are their own best advocates in maintaining the right to independently        homeschool. &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; does not mean doing it alone. Homeschoolers        have long used the resources of their community to augment their experiences.        Co-ops, groups of families who come together and share in educating their        children, have also been a part of homeschooling for a long time.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 As the popularity of homeschooling has increased, so have the        opportunities available. Museums, nature sanctuaries, performing arts        organizations, tutoring centers, private instructors, and entrepreneurs        all market classes and activities to homeschoolers. In addition to the à        la carte offerings by local institutions, learning centers (also called        microschools) are now common. At AHEM, our mission is to advocate for        &ldquo;independent homeschooling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		                 <p>
		                 What is meant by “independent”? The <a href="chapter_76.html">General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> require        children between the ages of 6 and 16 to attend public schools, approved        private schools, or be “otherwise instructed” in an approved manner.        Since 1987, Massachusetts courts have recognized that children who are        being educated at home in an approved manner fall into this “otherwise        instructed” category.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 The approval of home education plans is guided by the legal principles        and guidelines set forth in the decision of the 1987 Massachusetts        Supreme Court case, <em><a href="charles.html">Care and        Protection of Charles &amp; others</a></em>. This is known as case        law. Case law is created when courts make decisions on specific        circumstances of cases that come before them. The unique issue before the <em>Charles</em> court was how to accommodate the rights of parents under the US and        Massachusetts Constitutions while also upholding the governmental        interest in the education of its citizens. The court acknowledged that        &ldquo;the <strong>parents </strong>[emphasis        added] of school-age children possess a basic constitutional right in        directing their children&rsquo;s education…&rdquo; (<em>Charles</em> at 324). The court went on to        outline the guidelines parents must follow in order to teach their        children at home. Throughout it speaks of parents instructing their        children and directing their children's education (<em>Charles</em> at 334,        336, 339).</p>
		                 <p>
		                 While the ultimate interpretation of the laws and cases governing home        education in the state can only be determined by the courts, it is AHEM&rsquo;s        understanding of the intent of the<em> Charles</em> decision that children who are educated at home under        the primary direction of their parents are found to fall under the        umbrella of &ldquo;otherwise instructed&rdquo; (MGL Ch. 76 §1). It is this core        function of parents directing their children&rsquo;s education that defines        &ldquo;independent homeschooling,&rdquo; for which AHEM has advocated for more than        two decades.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 Given this definition, when we consider the spectrum of available        opportunities from the à la carte offerings which have always been        utilized by homeschoolers to five-day-a-week drop-off centers, we        question whether what is being offered may still be deemed &ldquo;independent        homeschooling.&rdquo; At some point learning centers and microschools that        provide a place for parents to leave their children for anywhere from        several hours to several days a week, where their education is        implemented if not directed by someone other than the parent, logically        become de facto private schools or daycare centers. This practice of        sending one&rsquo;s children to be educated by an unrelated adult in a location        outside the home for a majority of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; time could be difficult to        defend as homeschooling.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 In Massachusetts, private schools and daycare centers have their own sets        of regulations and criteria for approval and/or licensing. If the parent        is not perceived to be the instructor for the majority of the time, the        practice of using homeschooling law as a way to avoid getting licensed as        a daycare or approved as a private school could threaten the current        freedom to independently homeschool. A microschool or learning center        could come under scrutiny for any number of reasons. Increased scrutiny        could lead to laws, regulations or court cases that would further define        homeschooling and so restrict the freedoms that homeschooling parents        currently enjoy.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 Massachusetts homeschoolers can be active participants in protecting our        freedom to independently homeschool by demanding that these facilities        fulfill their legal responsibility as institutions caring for groups of        children on a daily basis and get approval from local school committees        to operate as private schools, or be licensed by the Massachusetts        Department of Early Education and Care as childcare programs.</p>
		                 <p>
		                 Before enrolling your child for more than a couple days a week, ask        questions:</p>
		                 <ul class="nested">
		                   <li>Are they approved by the local city or town as a <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/advisory/100207privateschool.html" target="_blank">private school</a>?</li>
		                   <li>If not, are they a licensed daycare provider?</li>
		                   <li>If not licensed, do they have written             notification of exemption? (See the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/criteria-for-exemption-from-licensing/download" target="_blank">Criteria for Exemption from Licensing</a>.)</li>
		                   <li>What health and safety protocols are in place?             Consider: training in CPR/first aid, fire inspections, food &amp;             allergy safety, etc.</li>
		                   <li>Are criminal background checks done for staff and             volunteers? What is the ratio of teachers to children? What training             or requirements are there for staff?</li>
		                   <li>Do they carry insurance? (Home-based facilities             may need insurance beyond their basic home insurance policy.)</li>
		                   <li>What is their philosophy of education? Who             determines the curriculum?</li>
		                   <li>What are their policies for discipline, parental             involvement, and communication?</li>
	                     </ul>
		                 <p>
		                   Keeping the distinction between homeschooling and private schooling or        day care helps preserve homeschooling freedom. Advocacy by individuals        helped create independent homeschooling and is what will help us preserve        it. You can <a href="best-advocate.html">be your own best advocate</a>, and, as        always, <a href="contact.html">reach out to AHEM</a> with any questions or        concerns you may have.</p>
