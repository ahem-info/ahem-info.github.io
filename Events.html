      <h2><a name="bandb" id="bandb"></a>Being  and Becoming - Arlington</h2>
      <p><strong> Thursday, September 29, 7:30 pm</strong>      </p>
      <p><em>Being and becoming is  a key that permits exiting a social system built on fear, a key that allows one  to look at life differently for and with our children, and for ourselves as  well. This film, in dazzling ways, has brought answers to my own inner child  who has become worn out, like everyone else, for having too long sustained her  survival without daring her life. This film, through the liberating testimony  of these pioneer families of “becoming self,” is a hymn to internal necessity.</em> —  Isabelle Adjani</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Considering homeschooling and would like a  non-threatening way (with popcorn!) to get a lot of your questions answered?      </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Want a fun night out with a family member or  friend who just doesn’t “get” homeschooling?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Or do you want the affirming experience of  watching this beautiful film about unschooling in the company of lots of others  who think outside the box?      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s your chance! AHEM is sponsoring a screening of Being and Becoming at the Capitol Theatre, 204 Massachusetts Ave,  Arlington, MA on Thursday, September 29 at 7:30 pm. </p>
      <p>After the 99-minute movie, there will be time (for those who  would like to stay) to discuss the movie with AHEM founders and unschooling  mothers Milva McDonald and Sophia Sayigh. We will be joined by special guest  Pat Farenga, a writer, speaker, and consultant who worked closely with John  Holt at <em>Growing Without Schooling</em> magazine.</p>
      <p><strong>Get tickets in  advance here: </strong><a href="http://ahembeingandbecoming.eventbrite.com">http://ahembeingandbecoming.eventbrite.com</a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Online  tickets cost $10 each, plus Eventbrite processing fee. No refunds after September  25.</p>
      <p>Space permitting, tickets at the door will be $15 each, cash  only.</p>
      <p><em>Being and Becoming</em> explores the theme of trusting children and their development, and invites us  to question our learning paradigms and options. The filmmaker takes us on a  journey of discovery through the US, France, the UK, and Germany (where it’s  illegal not to go to school). We meet parents who have made the choice of not  schooling their children, at school or at home, but of letting them learn  freely what they are truly passionate about. It is a quest for truth about the  innate desire to learn. It belongs to a wider theme than education, connected  to a change in our belief system and to our society’s evolution, as well as to  the importance of reclaiming one’s life and self-confidence.</p>

      <p>Exact location and directions will be provided to you about a week before the meeting.</p>

      <h2><a name="fair" id="fair"></a>Vendors Invitation to the AHEM Home Learners Fall Fair - Watertown, MA</h2>
      <p>The AHEM Home Learners Fall Fair will be held on <strong>Saturday, November 19, 1:30 - 4:30 pm</strong> at First Parish of Watertown, 35 Church  St., Watertown, MA. We are planning this to be a festive event with crafts for  sale,  entertainment, music and refreshments. This is a  wonderful opportunity for children and families to learn entrepreneurial skills  and experience a larger sense of community.   We hope you will join us.      </p>
      <p>Homeschooling families are invited to display and sell  their crafts, or perform music, storytelling, skits, dance, etc. <strong>For vendor applications visit <a href="https://ahemfallfairvendorapp.eventbrite.com">https://ahemfallfairvendorapp.eventbrite.com</a>.  Deadline for submitting applications is October 15.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>We are looking for fine quality handmade, home grown  crafts, kits, and small gifts that sell well to the general public.</strong> Vendors may  not sell bake sale goods or foods meant to be bought and consumed on the  premises.</p>
      <p><em>A note to parents: Children can be discouraged easily if  their crafts don’t sell up to their expectations.  Prepare your children for this possibility.  Use it to discuss marketing, demand, pricing, or other factors that will  influence sales. Call this an experiment to test the market and learn.</em></p>
      <p><strong>We are looking for performers.</strong> Performers are an integral  part of this event. People come for the performances as much as for the crafts,  and more attendees benefit all. Would you like to perform? Are you part of any  performing group? (Magic, circus, music, dance, gymnastics, drama, etc.) Would  you or some of your group be interested in performing at the Fair? Contact <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">info@ahem.info</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 ft. @ $20 (The number of electrical outlets is limited and we  cannot guarantee access to one.)</p>
      <p>The fair will be advertised widely.</p>
