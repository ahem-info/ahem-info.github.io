      <p>Calling all homeschool dads!
      </p>
      <p>Are you new to homeschooling or just considering homeschooling?  Wondering how to participate in your family's new journey?  Not sure how to explain homeschooling to your friends and colleagues?  Have reservations about following the educational path less traveled? </p>
      <p>Or are you a veteran homeschool dad looking to connect with other like-minded dads?   </p>
      <p>Please come to AHEM's Dads and Donuts event on <strong>Saturday, October 29 at 10:00 am</strong> in Arlington. Bring your questions and your wisdom to this casual conversation with other homeschool dads. Coffee and donuts will fuel the conversation!</p>
      <p><a href="https://ahemdadsanddonuts2.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Register online.</a></p>
      <p>Exact location and directions will be provided to you about a week before the meeting.</p>
      <p>The discussion will be geared toward adults, so we ask that you leave at home children who will be as happy or happier there with a loving caregiver.</p>
      <p>Cost is $15/person (teen and adult) to reserve your spot; the full price will be refunded to you, making your participation FREE. If you don't show up, your money will be donated to support the non-profit mission of AHEM.</p>
      <p>Space is limited. No refunds after October 21st except those made to meeting attendees.</p>
      <p>Participants will be added to the Friends of AHEM list unless they specifically opt out.</p>
      <p>Please respect AHEM’s mission to empower individuals through education by not soliciting for your business at this event.      </p>

We are planning this to be a festive event with crafts for  sale,  entertainment, music and refreshments. This is a  wonderful opportunity for children and families to learn entrepreneurial skills  and experience a larger sense of community.   We hope you will join us.      </p>
      <p>Homeschooling families are invited to display and sell  their crafts, or perform music, storytelling, skits, dance, etc. <strong>For vendor applications visit <a href="https://ahemfallfairvendorapp.eventbrite.com">https://ahemfallfairvendorapp.eventbrite.com</a>.  Deadline for submitting applications is October 15.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>We are looking for fine quality handmade, home grown  crafts, kits, and small gifts that sell well to the general public.</strong> Vendors may  not sell bake sale goods or foods meant to be bought and consumed on the  premises.</p>
      <p><em>A note to parents: Children can be discouraged easily if  their crafts don’t sell up to their expectations.  Prepare your children for this possibility.  Use it to discuss marketing, demand, pricing, or other factors that will  influence sales. Call this an experiment to test the market and learn.</em></p>
      <p><strong>We are looking for performers.</strong> Performers are an integral  part of this event. People come for the performances as much as for the crafts,  and more attendees benefit all. Would you like to perform? Are you part of any  performing group? (Magic, circus, music, dance, gymnastics, drama, etc.) Would  you or some of your group be interested in performing at the Fair? Contact <a href="mailto:info@ahem.info">info@ahem.info</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 ft. @ $20 (The number of electrical outlets is limited and we  cannot guarantee access to one.)</p>
      <p>The fair will be advertised widely.</p>
