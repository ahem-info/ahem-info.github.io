      <p>Join South Shore Home Learners for our 3rd Annual Not-Back-to-School Beach Day &amp; Picnic! Meet other homeschooling families, make new friends and connections! If you're new to homeschooling, bring any questions you have.      </p>
      <p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, September 5, from 10 a.m. onward (bring your lunch if you'd like)<br />
        <strong>Where:</strong> Duxbury Beach (access via the Powder Point Bridge). Look for a South Shore Home Learners T-shirt displayed near our group.We'll probably be the only group with school-aged kids :-)<br />
        <strong>Parking:</strong> After Labor Day, non-residents and cars without stickers are allowed to park in the lot to the left at the end of the Powder Point Bridge (parking is free).  A couple of years ago there was some confusion about this, as there was a sign saying that you needed a sticker.  Just tell the guard that you are meeting friends and that since it's after Labor Day, you know a sticker is not required.  You can also print out and refer to the parking regulations (Motor Vehicle Beach Regulations #2): <a href="http://www.duxburybeach.com/images/BeachR&amp;R.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.duxburybeach.com/images/BeachR&amp;R.pdf</a> <br />
      <strong>Rain Date:</strong> Monday, September 8, same time.  If the weather looks iffy, we will post any change in plans by 8 a.m. on 9/5. <strong>Questions:</strong> Email heidiconner at hotmail dot com</p>

<h2><a name="college" id="college"></a>College Bound</h2>
      <p>On <strong>Wednesday, September 24, 7:00 – 9:00 pm,</strong> AHEM will present &quot;College Bound.&quot; The program will be held in the Jefferson Cutter House, Arlington, MA center.      </p>
      <p>If going to college might be the next step of choice for your homeschooler, join us on September 24th. Can homeschoolers really get into college? Absolutely. The salon will be led by parents who have successfully navigated the college application process with their lifelong homeschoolers in the last two years. Topics will include choosing schools to apply to, tailoring a generic application form to reflect your homeschooling experience, and parental responsibilities as your child's &quot;guidance counselor.&quot; Sample application components will be shared via email following the event.   </p>
      <p>The discussion will be geared toward adults, so we ask that you leave at home children who will be as happy or happier there with a loving caregiver. Interested teens are welcome to attend. </p>
      <p>Cost is $15/person (teen and adult) to reserve your spot; the full price will be refunded to you, making your participation FREE. If you don't show up, your money will be donated to support the non-profit mission of AHEM. </p>

<h2><a name="socialization" id="socialization"></a>AHEM Salon: Rethinking Socialization </h2>
      <p>Come partake in lively, stimulating discussion with fellow homeschooling parents in a relaxed, friendly environment. The topic will be “Rethinking Socialization.”
      </p>
      <p>One of the first questions homeschooling families are asked is, “But what about socialization?” In this discussion we will examine our beliefs about what it means for children to be “socialized.” We will also brainstorm ideas for supporting homeschoolers as they forge meaningful connections with others and participate in groups and communities in a variety of social contexts.  </p>
<p>The meeting will take place on <strong>Thursday, October 16 at 7:00 PM</strong> in a meeting room at Panera Bread, 433 Paradise Rd., Swampscott, MA. If you want, you can purchase soups, salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and hot and cold drinks at Panera. Please do not bring outside food in. If you plan to purchase food, please try to arrive a few minutes early to order so we can begin the discussion promptly at 7:00 PM. </p>
<p>The discussion will be geared toward adults, so we ask that you leave at home children who will be as happy or happier there with a loving caregiver. Interested teens are welcome to attend. </p>
<p>Cost is $15/person (teen and adult) to reserve your spot; the full price will be refunded to you, making your participation <strong>FREE.</strong> If you don't show up, your money will be donated to support the non-profit mission of AHEM. </p>
