      <none>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr"><strong>Wednesday, February 11, 2015, 7:30 pm in Watertown, MA. <br />
        </strong>Come partake in lively,  stimulating discussion with fellow homeschooling parents in a relaxed, friendly  environment. The topic will be&nbsp;“Finding Balance.” </p>
        <p>The February topic is planned as a basis for  conversation, but attendees' needs and interests are our first concern. So feel  free to come meet others, and ask your burning questions, even if they don't  seem like they have anything to do with the evening's topic.        </p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr"> Homeschooling in the 21st  century can be overwhelming. Support groups, field trips, classes, learning  centers, dance lessons, AP courses, play groups, music, and more. Whatever  happened to informal park days and curling up on the couch with a good book? At  this salon, we'll talk about the sometimes tricky process of enjoying a  comfortable, low-stress homeschooling lifestyle, including ways to find balance  for working and single parents.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr">Exact location and  directions will be provided to you about a week before the meeting.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr">The discussion will be  geared toward adults, so we ask that you leave at home children who will be as  happy or happier there with a loving caregiver. Interested teens are welcome to  attend.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr"><strong>Cost</strong> is $15/person (teen  and adult) to reserve your spot; the full price will be refunded to you, making  your participation <strong>FREE.</strong> If you don't show up, your money will be donated to  support the non-profit mission of AHEM.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr"> Register online at <a href="http://ahemfindingbalance.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">http://ahemfindingbalance.eventbrite.com</a>.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr"> Space is limited. No  refunds after February 6th except those made to meeting attendees.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr">*Please note: This salon is  up some stairs in a home with cats and a dog.</p>
        <p class="twoColFixRtHdr">Salon  Series participants will be added to the <a href="http://www.ahem.info/BecomeaFriendofAHEM.htm" title="blocked::http://www.ahem.info/BecomeaFriendofAHEM.htm">Friends of AHEM</a> list unless they  specifically opt out. </p>
<h2> <a name="govt" id="govt"></a>How State Government Works: Q &amp; A with Massachusetts State Legislators</h2>
        <p><strong>Friday, February 13, 2015, 11:00 am in Swampscott, MA.</strong>    </p>
        <p> What better way to prepare for AHEM’s State House Day than an in-district, face-to-face meeting with Massachusetts State Legislators! </p>
        <p>State Senator Thomas McGee (D, Third Essex) and State Representative Lori Ehrlich (D, Eighth Essex) will be on hand to talk with homeschooling constituents <em>from any Massachusetts district</em> about all aspects of state government. This is an excellent opportunity to get answers to questions such as “What is the difference between a senator and a representative?”, “How are state laws passed?”, “What issues are you working on at the State House?” and many more. </p>
        <p>FREE but preregistration is required. Space is limited. Registrants will receive exact location and directions about a week before the event.  Register online: <a href="http://ahemhowstategovtworks.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">http://ahemhowstategovtworks.eventbrite.com</a></p>
        <p>Participants will be added to the <a href="BecomeaFriendofAHEM.html">Friends of AHEM</a> list unless they specifically opt out. </p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: If you sign up for this event, please do your best to attend. Remember: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you sign up, you are reserving a spot that then cannot be given to someone else.</li>
          <li>It is disrespectful of our host and reflects poorly on all homeschoolers when we reserve space, and a large part of our group doesn’t attend the event.</li>
          <li> If you sign up and do not show up, AHEM reserves the right to no longer treat your reservation request on a first come, first served basis for future AHEM events, only assigning you a spot should there be room after the deadline has been met. </li>
        </ul>
<h2><a name="alt" id="alt"></a>Panel Discussion: Alternatives to Four Year College</h2>
        <p><span class="twoColFixRtHdr"><strong>Wednesday, March 18, 2015, 7:30 pm in Berlin, MA. </strong></span>These days, the conventional wisdom is that four year college is a necessity  for a successful career. But not everyone is interested in college, and not  every job requires a university education. If you or your kids are interested  in a life path that might not include four year college, come hear a panel of  homeschooling parents and self-employed professionals talk about alternatives,  such as apprenticeships, entrepreneurship, trade schools and community college.  There will be time for questions and discussion.        </p>
        <h6>The  panel:</h6>
          <p><strong>          Shawn P. Bernard</strong>&nbsp;Shawn  Bernard is a father, real estate investor, sales trainer, personal coach, hobby  farmer, world traveler, incessant problem solver, early riser, poet, and owner  of Central Mass Real Estate. He is also an active Realtor with a one-per-week  personal sales average for the past two years. Shawn has a degree in Psychology  from Fitchburg State University. He lives on a small hobby farm in  Massachusetts and divides his time between Massachusetts and an organic coffee  farm in Maui. He is extremely grateful to be alive.</p>
          </p>
        <p><strong>Rob  Rains</strong>&nbsp;Rob and Sadie Rains are co-founders and co-owners of Wicked Easy  I.T., a small I.T. service provider. He is a high school graduate and has  attended some college, but does not hold a college degree. He is a Microsoft  Certified Systems Engineer with 17 years of experience in information  technology. Rob's business ownership helps him understand keenly the struggles  and expenses of small businesses, making him an empathetic and empowering  partner for small businesses who want to use technology effectively. Unlike  many I.T. professionals, Rob's passion is connecting with people and helping  them see possibilities they previously had not been able to see. Rob lives with  his amazing wife, Sadie, and their seven children. He is also an Eagle Scout  and actively volunteers in the Boy Scouts of America programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Manoj  Padki</strong>&nbsp;Manoj Padki is stay-at-home dad, a homeschooling father, acapella  singer, and real estate investor. He likes to cook and feed other people. His  favorite motto is “Follow your bliss.” He lives in a cohousing community with  his wife Manisha and their two children.</p>
        <p><strong>Milva  McDonald</strong>          Milva McDonald has been homeschooling for more than 20 years. During that time,  she's juggled raising and educating four children, working outside the home,  and pursuing her various interests. She has one child who didn’t go to college,  another who quit, a third who plans to attend college, and a fourth that’s  still on the fence. She is a co-founder of AHEM.</p>
        <p>The evening will be geared  toward adults, so we ask that you leave at home children who will be as happy  or happier there with a loving caregiver. Interested teens are welcome to  attend.</p>
        <p><strong>Cost</strong> is $15/person (teen and  adult) to reserve your spot; the full price will be refunded to you, making  your participation <strong>FREE.</strong> If you don't show up, your money will be donated to  support the non-profit mission of AHEM. Space is limited. No refunds  after March 13th except those made to meeting attendees. </p>
        <p>Exact location and directions  will be emailed about a week before the meeting.</p>

      <h2><a name="sgd" id="sgd"></a>Student Government Day</h2>
  <p>AHEM is thrilled to announce that homeschoolers will again  participate in Student Government Day on <strong>April 10, 2015</strong> at the State House in Boston!  The program is sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.  </p>
  <p>Nominations are now closed for  Student Governement Day 2015. Check back in Fall of 2016 for information on participating in Student Government Day 2016, or <a href="BecomeaFriendofAHEM.html">join our low volume announcement-only email list to be notified.</a>    </p>
  <h2> <a name="shd" id="shd"></a>State House Day</h2>
    <p><strong>Monday, April 13, 2015, 10:00 am in Boston, MA.<br />
    </strong>Join AHEM for a fun day in Boston  visiting the State House and visiting the Old South Meeting House! Prior to the  big day is the February 13 kickoff event <a href="#govt">(see above)</a>, and ongoing <a href="#civics">Civics Group</a>. </p>
    <h6>April  13, 2015 Schedule of Activities</h6>
      <p>10:00 am – 12:00 pm Visiting  Legislators &amp; Meeting Other Massachusetts Homeschoolers<br />
        12:00 – 1:00 pm Lunch  Break<br />
        1:00 – 3:00 pm Old  South Meeting House (may fill -- <a href="Documents/StateHouseDay2015registrationform.pdf">pre-registration required</a>)<br />
      </p>
      <h6>10:00 am – noon Visiting Legislators</h6>
    <p>2015 brings a new  group of legislators to the State House, so to encourage Massachusetts  homeschoolers to meet their representatives, AHEM is sponsoring an event on Monday, April 13, 2015 for homeschoolers to visit the State House  and meet with legislators.</p>
    <p>Meet in  Nurses Hall on the second floor of the State House to check in and peruse  handouts and displays about homeschooling in Massachusetts. AHEM  representatives will be available there between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm,  but we encourage you to arrive as close to 10:00 am as possible. </p>
    <p>Consider  calling or writing your representatives to make an appointment to meet them  while at the State House. You are more likely to meet them instead of an aide  if you make arrangements in advance. If you’re not sure who your  representatives are, you can find out here: <a href="http://www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.wheredoivotema.com/bal/myelectioninfo.aspx</a> Find a template in .pdf format for a letter or email here: <a href="Documents/WritetoYourElectedOfficialsTemplate.pdf">http://www.ahem.info/Documents/WritetoYourElectedOfficialsTemplate</a></p>
    <p>While at the State House, take  time for a self-guided tour of the historic building, network with other  Massachusetts homeschoolers, have fun completing the AHEM scavenger hunt and/or  ice breaker game, and more. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free, but we can plan better for the event if you take the time to pre-register,  so we strongly encourage registering in advance. <a href="Documents/StateHouseDay2015registrationform.pdf">Download a registration form in pdf format here</a>.  </p>
<h6>12:00 – 1:00 pm Lunch  on your own</h6>
<p>There  are many options. Pack a brown bag lunch, find fast food or a food truck at  Downtown Crossing, discover an eclectic café on Charles St., or head to  Chinatown.
</p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> Public Garden — For families with young children a nice  choice might be to picnic in the Public Garden, and visit the Make Way for  Ducklings statues. For older kids E. B. White’s The Trumpet of the Swan  and/or Esther Forbes’s Johnny Tremain provide interesting context for a  visit to downtown Boston (see <a href="ExploringMA.html">Exploring Massachusetts</a> for more ideas).  </p>
