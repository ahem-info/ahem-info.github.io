      <h2><strong>Debunking the Myths of Home Education in “Class Dismissed”</strong></h2>
      <p><a href="http://cdboston.brownpapertickets.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/CD_PosterSmall.jpg" width="144" height="210" alt="Class Dismissed" /></a></p>
      <none>
        <p>        Advocates  for Home Education in Massachusetts (AHEM) will sponsor the Boston screening of  the world's 1st feature-length documentary exploring the rapidly growing  homeschool movement! <strong>“Class Dismissed,” </strong>a  revealing new documentary which explores the challenges and triumphs of home  education, will be screened Monday, December 1, 7:30 pm at the Regent Theatre,  7 Medford St., Arlington, MA, with the filmmaker in attendance.</p>
<p>“Class  Dismissed” follows one family’s quest to better their children’s lives by  pulling them out of one of the highest-rated schools in L.A. Parents Rachel and  Todd are frustrated by the rigid state-imposed standards of the modern  educational system and hope 21st century technology and new research  will provide a means for their two daughters to earn a quality education  outside the modern school system. They quickly discover that they must overcome  long-standing assumptions about education and face the social ramifications of  their bold experiment.</p>
        <p>Jeremy  Stuart makes his directorial debut with “Class Dismissed.” His career spans  over 20 years in TV and film. He’s worked on hundreds of music videos,  commercials, and award-winning documentaries and shorts for Lucasfilm, National  Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, the Smithsonian Channel, and others.  Himself a product of a traditional educational system, Stuart became  disenchanted with his high school curriculum as a teenager and trained his  energies on music and, ultimately, film editing.</p>
        <p><em>“Everything I’ve learned as an adult  I learned because I wanted to, but more importantly because I was passionate  about it,” says Stuart. “But I’ve always felt that it should have been this way  from the beginning.”</em></p>
        <p>Though he  was disappointed in his own educational experience, when he became a father 10  years ago, Stuart assumed he’d enroll his daughter in a traditional school.  Like most people, he wasn’t aware there were other choices, but then he and his  wife attended a home education conference in Sacramento -- it was a  game-changer for Stuart.</p>
        <p><em>“What completely sold me were the  kids,” says Stuart. “I had never met kids who were so full of life and  curiosity and so comfortable with themselves and those around them. If these  kids, teens, and young adults were the result of homeschooling then I was ready  to sign up.”</em></p>
        <p>Ten years  later, Stuart is even more confident about the advantages of home education. We  learn in “Class Dismissed” that home education is not a one-size-fits-all  program – rather, there are many different approaches to alternative learning  that can work. </p>
        <p>“<em>Choosing to educate your kids outside of a conventional  school is a process of trial and error and constant evolution,” explains  Stuart. “It’s a process that requires extraordinary trust and a willingness to  undo much of our own conditioning about how children learn, and an  understanding of how as parents we support or hinder that process.”</em></p>
        <p>Inaccurate  perceptions of social consequences are rampant, and Stuart admits they are  deeply entrenched in our culture. In one segment, he interviews people on the  street to gather their opinions of home education, which almost always default  to the socialization myth. This mindset is what Stuart is particularly  interested in confronting with “Class Dismissed”.</p>
        <p><em>“Ironically, school is the only time  in life where you’ll be forced to socialize with people more or less the same  age,” says Stuart. “This doesn’t happen elsewhere in life, where we interact  and socialize with people of all ages. Kids who are educated outside a  traditional classroom get to experience this on a daily basis, which is a much  richer and accurate experience of what it means to socialize.”</em></p>
        <p>Perhaps the  greatest strength of “Class Dismissed” is its ability to take us along for the  ride, through the tough questions and concerns Rachel and Todd have about home  education and the insecurities they feel about choosing such an unconventional  path. The audience experiences their fears and convictions, their failures and  their victories. It’s a journey the director feels is worth taking, if for no  other reason than to broaden one’s perception of what’s possible in the world  of education.</p>
        <p><em>“I want the film to speak to ordinary  people who may not be aware that they have options when it comes to educating  their children, and to show that those options are within reach for most  people,” says Stuart. “I want the audience to feel moved to do something and to  walk away with their hearts and minds opened to the prospect of new  possibilities for themselves and their families.”</em></p>
        <p>Get your  tickets here: <strong><a href="http://cdboston.brownpapertickets.com/">http://cdboston.brownpapertickets.com/</a></strong>.  Admission $10. Don’t delay – all West Coast screenings sold out! Q&amp;A with  the filmmakers follows the screening. AHEM (<a href="http://www.ahem.info">www.ahem.info</a>) will be on hand with info about  homeschooling in Massachusetts. We encourage you to invite friends or family whom  you think will benefit from the alternative education insights this film  provides.      </p>

      <h2><a name="osv" id="osv"></a>Homeschool Day at Old Sturbridge Village</h2>
  <p>Preparing for winter in the 21th century may mean removal of the summer air conditioners, installing storm windows and tuning up the snow blower.  Most modern households are unconcerned about stocking up on food supplies to last until next summer, stacking fifteen cords of firewood or having enough hay and feed for the animals.     Come join us for Home School Day on <strong>November 5th</strong> and explore the preparations needed for the long winter season ahead.  Included in the day's activities are:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Pickling, Potting and  Preserving: Keeping vegetables until spring</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Preserving Cider for the table</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Keeping warm with woolens</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Threshing grain and shelling corn</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Smoking and salting: Meat preservation</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Filling the woodsheds</p>
      </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mending fences </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
<p>The November Homeschool Day is filled with activities to help you better understand the way our ancestors  not only survived the winter months, but anticipated a season filled with leisure time and an abundance of food.  We hope that you join us on November 5th as Old Sturbridge Village prepares for the coming winter.            </p>
<p>Our Home School Days offer you and your children the opportunity to explore the Village and participate in hands-on activities. This is a great opportunity for children to gain exposure to many aspects of 1830s New England life in an interactive way.   We recommend that you allow for up to three hours to visit the Village, in addition to any scheduled hands-on studios. </p>
<p>If time permits, consider making a quick craft in the Hands-on Crafts Center; $5-10 per activity (first come, first served); some age and safety restrictions apply.  </p>
<p>Home School Day Admission ($8 per person) is not included with the price of the studio. Home School parents also receive the $8 admission rate at a ratio of one adult to one child between the ages of 5 &amp; 17. Cost for the Studios is $5.00 per person, per studio.  <a href="https://www.osv.org/event/home-school-day/home-school-day-1" target="_blank">Learn more and purchase tickets. </a></p>

  <h2><a name="sgd" id="sgd"></a>Student Government Day</h2>
  <p>AHEM is thrilled to announce that homeschoolers will again be able to participate in Student Government Day on <strong>April 10, 2015</strong> at the State House in Boston! The annual Student Government Day will begin with check-in at 8:30 a.m. and will conclude at 1:00 p.m. The program is sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.  </p>
  <p>Students must be nominated to participate, and a lottery will be held to determine a participant and an alternate. <strong>Nominations must be postmarked by December 12, 2014 at the latest.</strong> Details below. </p>
<p>In 1947, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted this program which is traditionally held on a Friday in April. This is an informative program about state government that includes students participating in the role of elected or appointed officials to “observe the processes of government.” The program provides educators and students with many opportunities to learn firsthand about state government. It enables government officials to have contact with students. It allows students to voice their positions on important current issues through prepared debates. It enables students to participate in the legislative process through simulated committee hearings and House and Senate formal sessions. It provides the opportunity for students to exchange views with their peers throughout the state on statewide issues.  </p>
<h6>How does this program work?</h6>
  <p>Students will be assigned the roles of senators, representatives, constitutional officers and Justices of the Supreme Court. In March, information will be posted on the Massachusetts Department of Education website indicating the roles that each district's student(s) will play on Student Government Day. The website will also provide information about the bills that will be debated, further details about the day itself, and background information about the state government system.
    </p>
  </p>
  <p>On Student Government Day, students are able to experience the roles of members of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government. Many students will participate as legislators in House and Senate sessions. All students may take part in a simulated committee hearing. Others will visit various elected and appointed office holders and staff as they carry out their daily activities.  </p>
<h6>Who is eligible to participate?</h6> 
  <p>Homeschooled high school students in their junior or senior year.
