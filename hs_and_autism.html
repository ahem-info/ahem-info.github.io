		   <h1>Homeschooling and Autism: Teaching to Strengths</h1>
		   <h4>By Lisa Rudy</h4>
               <p>When you have a child with autism, the public systems seem to  reach out and pull you in. Early intervention professionals recommend  appropriate preschools where therapists are available. Before you have a chance  to turn around, you're meeting with school officials to put together IEPs,  NOREPs, accommodations and behavioral interventions… and you begin to feel that  educating your child is so complex that it requires a team of highly paid  experts just to explain what will happen, where it will happen, why it will  happen, and who will be making it happen.</p>
               <p>With so many acronyms, therapists, specially trained teachers and  special equipment involved, how could a mere parent possibly manage to  homeschool a child with autism? And why, with so much available publicly, would  anyone want to?</p>
               <p>We came to homeschooling reluctantly. Our son is mildly autistic  (with an official diagnosis of PDD-NOS - pervasive developmental disorder not  otherwise specified), and we were sure the public system would be the ideal  choice for his educational needs.</p>
               <p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
               <p>Sadly, the American school system is set up with legal constraints  which force parents, teachers and administrators to educate autistic children  with one goal in mind: to help them become as typical in behavior, thinking, and  learning style as possible. The ideal outcome, again legally enforced, is for a  child with autism to look, think, and act typically enough to be able to  function adequately in a general education classroom.</p>
               <p>To achieve this goal, schools create individualized plans to  remediate delays, fix problems, and teach social skills. Individualized plans  are not designed to build on strengths, teach to different learning skills, or  support self-esteem. Even academics may often come second.</p>
               <p>What this meant to us was constant war. We argued for better  academics and higher expectations, but were told that academics were the least  of our worries. We wanted Tom to take ordinary field trips to zoos or museums,  but his class went to the supermarket and McDonald's. Tom wanted to build  dioramas and write stories, but between social skills groups and handwriting  therapy, there simply wasn't time.</p>
               <p>The breaking point came when, in fourth grade, he still hadn't  learned multiplication. I asked, at a meeting, <q>How will he ever get through  high school if he doesn't move forward with math?</q> The administrator  looked at me quizzically and asked, <q>Why are you worried about that?</q></p>
               <p>The next year, we started homeschooling.</p>
               <p>Initially, our goal was to engage our son in active learning based  on his real interests and abilities. We were both working (for ourselves), but  we were determined to make it work.</p>
               <p>That first year (fifth grade) was a lot of fun. We had moved to  Cape Cod, and we took advantage of our location and Tom's interests to create multidisciplinary  unit studies. We went on a whale watch and studied humpbacks. We followed the  old Cape Cod railroads and rode on a few lines. We explored ponds, went bird  watching, and read the books Tom already loved through movies (it was the first  time he'd been asked to read a novel or write a book report). The only  therapeutic intervention we pursued was speech therapy, and the only connection  Tom had to the school district was after school participation in the jazz band  (he plays clarinet). We were determined that, by building on interests and  abilities, we'd be able to include Tom in the wide world without the need for  special supports or hours of therapy aimed only at making him more like  everyone else.</p>
               <p>Over time, we joined homeschool groups and signed up for  homeschool gym at the Y. These were trickier, because of course they weren't  <q>adaptive,</q> and Tom sometimes fell behind, misunderstood, or simply  couldn't do what he was asked. But we persevered, and enrolled him in a  candlepin bowling league, a summer band camp, and a homeschool biography fair.</p>
               <p>As we've progressed with homeschooling (it's now our third year),  we've found that some things were easier and some were tougher than we had  anticipated. We also learned that homeschooling a child with autism really does  require the involvement of multiple people&mdash;and that finding those people  takes research and tenacity. Math was very hard indeed, and we went to several  tutors before finding the perfect match. Making <q>true friends</q> is  very hard (though probably no harder than it would have been in school); and  executive skills (planning, seeing the big picture, etc.) remain elusive.</p>
               <p>To work on social and collaborative skills, we've signed Tom up  for two days a week of small classes with a homeschooling mom/teacher, and he's  connecting well with homeschoolers who range in age from younger to about his  age. We've <q>caved</q> on the issue of therapy, and have signed him up  for a social skills group to work on the basics of conversation, group  dynamics, and body language.</p>
           <p>While we are solidly behind homeschooling, our hope for Tom is  that he will build the skills he needs to be included as a full member of a  small school community. Our reasons for this are both practical and  philosophical. On the practical side, we are finding it very hard to provide a  high quality homeschool experience while also providing food, clothing and  shelter for a family of four (including Tom's younger, public-schooled sister).  On the philosophical side, we know that a child with autism really does need  the experience of being part of group, and that the skills of true  collaboration are very hard to teach in a one-on-one parent-child setting.</p>
           <p><em>To chronicle her first year of homeschooling, Lisa created a  blog, </em><a href="http://teachingtommy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Teaching Tommy</a>,<em> which includes photos and details of many of her family's activities. She's  written articles about homeschooling and autism for her <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/autism-4014759" target="_blank">website</a>, (a part of </em>The New York  Times Company's About.com<em> site). She's also written a book for parents of  children with autism. The  book isn't about homeschooling per se: instead, its focus (and its name)  is </em><a href="https://amzn.to/2TvDd3Q">Get Out, Explore  and Have Fun: Getting the Most Out of Community Activities with Your Child with  Autism or Asperger Syndrome</a>.</p>
