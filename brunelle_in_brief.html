		   <h1>Brunelle, in Brief</h1>
		   <p>The Brunelle case was heard and decided by the Massachusetts  Supreme Judicial Court in 1998, following a decision of a lower court, the  Massachusetts Superior Court, that held home visits were a valid requirement  for approval of home education plans. The Brunelle and Pustell families  appealed the lower court decision.</p>
               <p>The facts of the case are as follows. Both the Brunelle and  Pustell families gave notice to Lynn school officials of their intention to  homeschool their children. The school committee and other school officials  examined their plans, and were satisfied with the qualifications of the parents  as teachers, the contents of the curricula and instructional materials to be  used, the amount of time that would be spent on instruction, and the methods of  evaluation that would be used. In addition, the Lynn School Committee also  required periodic home visits before granting approval for home education  plans. Both families refused to consent to home visits, arguing that such  visits violated Mass G.L. sec. 76, chapter 1, and certain provisions of the  Massachusetts Constitution.</p>
               <p>The Brunelles argued that Mass G.L. section 76, chapter 1  (the compulsory attendance statute) provided a statutory exemption for  homeschoolers, <q>such attendance shall not be required... of a child who is  being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the  superintendent or the school committee.</q> The court agreed that this  exemption authorizes approved home education for children and <q>in doing  so, protects the basic right of parents to direct the education of their  children.</q></p>
               <p>While this right is subject to the State's interest in  seeing that children receive an education, the Brunelle court reiterated the  holding in Charles: <q>the approval of a home education plan must not be  conditioned on requirements that are not essential to the State's  interest,</q> and that school officials could enforce, through the approval  process, certain reasonable requirements. The court agreed with the Brunelles'  claim that a home visit is not presumptively essential to the protection of the  State's interest.</p>
               <p>The Lynn School Department articulated several reasons for  their perceived need for home visits. The Brunelle court countered that  <q>these reasons have to be measured against the nature of home education,  which in certain important ways can never be the equivalent of in-school  education. For example, at home, there are no other students, no classrooms,  and no rigid schedules.</q> The court said <q>while the State can insist  that the child's education be moved along in a way that can be objectively  measured, it cannot apply institutional standards to this non-institutional  setting.</q></p>
               <p>The school officials argued that home visits were necessary  to ensure that there was a schedule that was being followed. The court said  that while a schedule is needed in a school setting, <q>the perception and  use of time in a home school is different.</q> The court noted that parents  <q>can observe and accommodate variations in the learning process, and teach  through a process that paces each student.</q> The school department argued  that home visits were needed to ensure adequate instructional space. The court  rejected this argument, saying <q>we doubt that parents, who are so  committed to home education that they are willing to forgo the public schools,  and devote substantial time and energy to teaching their children, will let the  children's progress suffer for lack of adequate instructional space.</q></p>
               <p>The court also rejected the school committee's claim that  home visits were needed to verify that there were teaching materials present.  The court said that while homeschooling parents can be asked to identify  teaching materials that will be used, <q>some of the most effective  curricular materials may not be tangible. For example travel, community  service, visits to educationally enriching facilities and places, and meeting  with various resource people can provide important learning experiences apart  from the four corners of a text or workbook.</q></p>
               <p>Finally, the court noted that both the Supreme Court and the  Massachusetts SJC have emphasized the protected right of parents to raise their  children without unnecessary government intrusion on familial privacy. Based on  this, <q>home education proposals can be made subject only to essential and  reasonable requirements.</q> Since the court found that the requirement of  home visits is not essential, the court held that the Lynn school officials, or  any other school officials, cannot, in the absence of consent, require home  visits as a condition to the approval of a home education plan.</p>
               <p>The Brunelle court never considered the constitutional  arguments made by the Brunelle family since they were able to reach a decision  without delving into the constitutional claims asserted. Most courts will try  to decide a case without delving into constitutional issues if they are able.  Once they decide a case on constitutional grounds, the decision will usually  have ramifications in other areas as well. Therefore, they try to keep their  decision as narrow as possible, so that their decision will only apply to the  question before them.</p>
